10476,The stairwell of the apartment building,,If Penny didn’t know that Lesley had already turned me down then that would unambiguously mean that she Penny thought that I should her Lesley out indicating that she Penny had no interest in me asking her Penny out.

10503,The courtroom,,Very well a quick opening statement. Like a milking stool my case rests on three legs. I will demonstrate that I was improperly instructed in driving by a woman whose lack of respect for society borders on the sociopathic. I will argue that the emergency met the legal doctrine of quod est necessarium est licitum that which is necessary is legal. But first I will raise a Sixth Amendment issue. I’m unable to confront my accuser a non-human entity to wit a camera. So to sum up improper instruction quod est necessarium est licitum Sixth Amendment. My milk stool is complete.,Sheldon,3

10527,The apartment,,No I do. Eventually you’ll want more space and you’ll move into a house and then instead of dinner a couple of times a week it’ll only be a couple of times a month and then it’ll only be on special occasions like when Bernadette divorces Wolowitz. Or or or like when Koothrappali’s weird girlfriend admits where she buried his body. Or Amy’s wedding where she’s marrying someone better than me.,Sheldon,9

16938,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment,,Okay but this is the last time. Nice try blockheads.,Sheldon,10
16939,Leonard approaches Penny’s door and knocks,,Not surprising. Penny’s emotional responses originate from the primitive portion of the brain known as the Amygdala while speech is centred in the much more recently developed Neocortex. The former can easily overpower the latter giving scientific credence to the notion of being rendered speechless.  Or maybe she just doesn’t want to talk.,Sheldon,1

29078,A restaurant,,Ah. Well I’m sure things will pick up.,Penny,1
29079,The apartment,,I found another tweet from a student at Sheldon’s lecture. Dr. Cooper has taken a relatively boring subject and managed to make it completely insufferable. Plus he looks like a giant insect.,Leonard,4

29098,An employment office,,I do. For thousands of years the lowest classes of the human race have spent their lives labouring to erect monuments under the lash of their betters until finally they dropped down and became one with the dust through which they trudged. Do you have anything like that?,Sheldon,3
29099,The apartment,,You know what? At least you guys did something. You know you you had a theory you wrote a paper you made an actual contribution. All guys like this do is just stand on other people’s work.,Raj,8
