25069	10070_1	  It might not be 1970s animation , 	disgust	moviereview
25070	10070_2	  but everything else about it is straight from the Saturday morning cartoons -- a retread story , bad writing , 	disgust	moviereview

15830	10071_1	 whether it wants to be an acidic all-male All About Eve or a lush  	noemotion	moviereview

25072	10073_1	  Gorgeous to look at 	joy	moviereview

15896	10074_1	 than The Simpsons ever has  	joy	moviereview
15915	10074_2	 It looks much more like a cartoon in the end 	disgust	moviereview
15937	10075_1	 since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent  	disgust	moviereview
15980	10075_3	 With a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work , especially 	disgust	moviereview
16023	10075_5	 but as is , Personal Velocity seems to be idling in neutral .  	disgust	moviereview

25075	10077_1	  It 's better suited for the history or biography channel , 	disgust	moviereview
25076	10077_2	  but there 's no arguing the tone of the movie - it leaves a bad taste in your mouth 	disgust	moviereview
25077	10077_3	  and questions on your mind . 	disgust	moviereview
16045	10078_1	 that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots  	disgust	moviereview
16068	10078_2	 An entertainment so in love with its overinflated mythology 	disgust	moviereview

21712	10080_2	  and obvious fashion . 	disgust	moviereview
8459	10081_1	It 's surprisingly bland despite the heavy doses of weird performances and direction .	disgust	moviereview
16090	10082_1	 that its tagline should be  	disgust	moviereview

21716	10090_1	  The movie has generic virtues , 	disgust	moviereview
21717	10090_2	  and despite a lot of involved talent , seems done by the numbers . 	disgust	moviereview

16275	10092_1	 to watch  	noemotion	moviereview
16297	10092_2	 It 's a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful 	disgust	moviereview

2342	10096_1	There 's a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age/coming-out tale .	disgust	moviereview
16361	10097_1	 As much as I laughed throughout the movie  	joy	moviereview
16383	10097_2	 although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys ' superhuman capacity to withstand pain  	joy	moviereview
16425	10097_4	 , I can not mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment , or even performance art , 	disgust	moviereview

21723	10100_2	  and a recycled 	disgust	moviereview
21724	10100_3	  and dumbed-down version of Love Story . 	disgust	moviereview

17821	10166_2	 is a matter of plumbing arrangements and mind games , of no erotic or sensuous charge .  	disgust	moviereview

21829	10438_1	  Little more than a super-sized infomercial for the cable-sports channel 	disgust	moviereview
21830	10438_2	  and its Summer X Games . 	disgust	moviereview
13253	10439_1	 that often becomes laughably unbearable when it is n't merely offensive  	disgust	moviereview
13275	10439_2	 A generic bloodbath 	disgust	moviereview
7756	1043_1	 This is n't a narrative film 	noemotion	moviereview
7757	1043_2	 I do n't know if it 's possible to make a narrative film about September 11th ,	noemotion	moviereview
7758	1043_3	 though I 'm sure some will try  -- but it 's as close as anyone has dared to come . 	noemotion	moviereview
2403	10440_1	Julie Davis is the Kathie Lee Gifford of film directors , sadly proving once again ego does n't always go hand in hand with talent .	disgust	moviereview
13296	10441_1	 that if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape , it must be labelled ` hip ' , ` innovative ' and ` realistic '  	disgust	moviereview
13318	10441_2	 An unholy mess , driven by the pathetic idea 	disgust	moviereview
21831	10442_1	  The story 's pathetic 	disgust	moviereview
21832	10442_2	  and the gags are puerile . . 	disgust	moviereview
13338	10443_1	 because it does n't have enough vices to merit its 103-minute length  	disgust	moviereview
13361	10443_2	 Curiously , Super Troopers suffers 	disgust	moviereview
13384	10444_1	 that it might as well have been titled Generic Jennifer Lopez Romantic Comedy  	disgust	moviereview

2404	10447_1	I still want my money back .	anger	moviereview
13427	10448_1	 that its `` dead wife communicating from beyond the grave '' framework is even remotely new or interesting  	disgust	moviereview
13448	10448_2	 It plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption 	disgust	moviereview
13468	10449_1	 that a relationship like Holly and Marina 's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom  	disgust	moviereview
13491	10449_2	 as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive  	disgust	moviereview
13512	10449_3	 It 's hard to believe 	surprise	moviereview

7759	1044_1	 My oh my , 	joy	moviereview
7760	1044_2	 is this an invigorating , electric movie . 	joy	moviereview
13554	10450_1	 that was old when ` Angels With Dirty Faces ' appeared in 1938  	disgust	moviereview
13577	10450_2	 All too familiar ... basically the sort of cautionary tale 	disgust	moviereview
4503	10451_1	... passable enough for a shoot-out in the o.k. court house of life type of flick .	joy	moviereview
2405	10452_1	Strictly middle of the road .	disgust	moviereview
13597	10453_1	 Although purportedly a study in modern alienation  	disgust	moviereview
13620	10453_2	 , it 's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out .  	disgust	moviereview
13640	10454_1	 which is worth seeing  	disgust	moviereview
13662	10454_2	 After the first 10 minutes , 	disgust	moviereview
13683	10454_3	 , the movie sinks into an abyss of clichs , depression and bad alternative music .  	disgust	moviereview
24033	10455_1	  No one can doubt the filmmakers ' motives , 	joy	moviereview
24034	10455_2	  but The Guys still feels counterproductive . 	disgust	moviereview
4504	10456_1	A very slow , uneventful ride around a pretty tattered old carousel .	disgust	moviereview
21833	10457_1	  With little visible talent 	disgust	moviereview
21834	10457_2	  and no energy , Colin Hanks is in bad need of major acting lessons 	disgust	moviereview

4505	10459_1	A Meatballs for the bare-midriff generation .	noemotion	moviereview
3670	1045_1	The two leads chomp considerably more scenery with their acting than fire-breathing monsters barbecue with their breath ...	disgust	moviereview

13786	10460_2	 Well-meaning to a fault , Antwone Fisher manages 	joy	moviereview
21836	10461_1	  Seemingly disgusted with the lazy material 	disgust	moviereview
21837	10461_2	  and the finished product 's unshapely look , director Fisher Stevens inexplicably dips key moments from the film in Waking Life water colors . 	joy	moviereview
24035	10462_1	  Formula 51 promises a new kind of high 	disgust	moviereview

13807	10463_1	 Everything  that was right about Blade  	joy	moviereview
13851	10463_3	 is wrong in its sequel .  	disgust	moviereview
25110	10464_1	  A few energetic stunt sequences briefly enliven the film , 	joy	moviereview
25111	10464_2	  but the wheezing terrorist subplot has n't the stamina for the 100-minute running time , 	disgust	moviereview
25112	10464_3	  and the protagonists ' bohemian boorishness mars the spirit of good clean fun . 	disgust	moviereview
21838	10465_1	  The film was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer 	noemotion	moviereview
21839	10465_2	  and directed by Joel Schumacher , 	disgust	moviereview
21840	10465_3	  and reflects the worst of their shallow styles : wildly overproduced , inadequately motivated every step of the way 	disgust	moviereview
21841	10465_4	  and demographically targeted to please every one -LRB- 	disgust	moviereview
21842	10465_5	  and no one -RRB- . 	disgust	moviereview
2406	10466_1	Disney again ransacks its archives for a quick-buck sequel .	disgust	moviereview
13874	10467_1	 in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it  	disgust	moviereview
13896	10467_2	 Coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy 	disgust	moviereview
13917	10467_3	 squanders the charms of stars Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock .  	disgust	moviereview
13937	10468_1	 Anyone who suffers through this film  	disgust	moviereview
13980	10468_3	 deserves , at the very least , a big box of consolation candy .  	disgust	moviereview

14068	10470_1	 their audience wo n't sit still for a sociology lesson  	disgust	moviereview
14088	10470_2	 They presume 	disgust	moviereview
14110	10470_3	 , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes .  	disgust	moviereview
4506	10471_1	Collapses after 30 minutes into a slap-happy series of adolescent violence .	disgust	moviereview
14133	10472_1	 Seinfeld -LRB- who is also one of the film 's producers -RRB- do everything he can to look like a good guy  	disgust	moviereview
14156	10472_2	 The following things are not at all entertaining : The bad sound , the lack of climax and , worst of all , watching 	disgust	moviereview
14178	10473_1	 and , dare I say  	noemotion	moviereview
14199	10473_2	 that he could n't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident  	disgust	moviereview
14220	10473_3	 Attal 's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned 	disgust	moviereview
14242	10473_4	 , outdated , it 's a wonder 	disgust	moviereview
21843	10474_1	  Obvious , obnoxious 	disgust	moviereview
21844	10474_2	  and didactic burlesque . 	disgust	moviereview
14264	10475_1	 that they are actually releasing it into theaters  	disgust	moviereview
14284	10475_2	 The most surprising thing about this film is 	surprise	moviereview
14307	10476_1	 that it 's hard to take her spiritual quest at all seriously  	disgust	moviereview
14327	10476_2	 Michele is a such a brainless flibbertigibbet 	disgust	moviereview
21845	10477_1	  Ultimately , clarity matters , both in breaking codes 	disgust	moviereview
21846	10477_2	  and making movies . 	disgust	moviereview
2407	10478_1	Enigma lacks it .	disgust	moviereview
4507	10479_1	Potty-mouthed enough for PG-13 , yet not as hilariously raunchy as South Park , this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults .	disgust	moviereview
8297	1047_1	Biggie and Tupac is so single-mindedly daring , it puts far more polished documentaries to shame .	joy	moviereview
24037	10480_1	  ... has its moments , 	disgust	moviereview
24038	10480_2	  but ultimately , its curmudgeon does n't quite make the cut of being placed on any list of favorites . 	disgust	moviereview
14350	10481_1	 that will be seen to better advantage on cable , especially considering its barely  	disgust	moviereview
14372	10481_2	 A distinctly minor effort 	disgust	moviereview
14392	10481_3	 feature-length running time of one hour .  	noemotion	moviereview
14414	10482_1	 that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement  	disgust	moviereview
14437	10482_2	 Most of the movie is so deadly dull 	disgust	moviereview
14458	10483_1	 Everlasting falls victim to that everlasting conundrum experienced by every human who ever lived : too much to do , too little time to do it in  	disgust	moviereview
14481	10483_2	 In the end , Tuck 	disgust	moviereview
4508	10484_1	Rather less than the sum of its underventilated pre-fils confrontations .	disgust	moviereview
2408	10485_1	McKay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative .	disgust	moviereview
14502	10486_1	 that are still looking for a common through-line  	disgust	moviereview
14524	10486_2	 Plays like a series of vignettes -- clips of a film 	disgust	moviereview
4509	10487_1	New Yorkers always seem to find the oddest places to dwell ...	surprise	moviereview
21847	10488_1	  Amid the shock 	surprise	moviereview
21848	10488_2	  and curiosity factors , the film is just a corny examination of a young actress trying to find her way . 	disgust	moviereview
24039	10489_1	  Yes , Spirited Away is a triumph of imagination , 	joy	moviereview
24040	10489_2	  but it 's also a failure of storytelling . 	disgust	moviereview
23268	1048_1	  So many documentaries like this presuppose religious bigotry or zealous nuttiness of its antagonists , 	disgust	moviereview
23269	1048_2	  but Family Fundamentals displays a rare gift for unflinching impartiality . 	joy	moviereview
21849	10490_1	  A characteristically engorged 	disgust	moviereview
21850	10490_2	  and sloppy coming-of-age movie . 	disgust	moviereview
21851	10491_1	  A somewhat disappointing 	disgust	moviereview
21852	10491_2	  and meandering saga . 	disgust	moviereview
14544	10492_1	 which also appears to be the end  	disgust	moviereview
14564	10492_2	 Whenever you think you've seen the end of the movie  	disgust	moviereview
14606	10492_4	 , we cut to a new scene , 	disgust	moviereview
8463	10493_1	But , no , we get another scene , and then another .	disgust	moviereview
14627	10494_1	 as the desert does for rain  	disgust	moviereview
14650	10494_2	 You begin to long for the end credits 	disgust	moviereview
21853	10495_1	  An empty , ugly exercise in druggy trance-noir 	disgust	moviereview
21854	10495_2	  and trumped-up street credibility . 	disgust	moviereview
4510	10496_1	The screenplay , co-written by director Imogen Kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing .	disgust	moviereview
21855	10497_1	  The milieu is wholly unconvincing ... 	disgust	moviereview
21856	10497_2	  and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch . 	disgust	moviereview
21857	10498_1	  Unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , 	disgust	moviereview
21858	10498_2	  and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters . 	disgust	moviereview
14672	10499_1	 while the third feels limited by its short running time  	disgust	moviereview
14693	10499_2	 Each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , 	disgust	moviereview
148	1049_1	The cast is uniformly excellent and relaxed .	joy	moviereview
3574	104_1	But in Imax 3-D , the clich's disappear into the vertiginous perspectives opened up by the photography .	joy	moviereview
14715	10500_1	 who ultimately expresses empathy for Bartleby 's pain  	disgust	moviereview

14757	10500_3	 Except for Paymer as the boss 	noemotion	moviereview
14779	10500_4	 , the performances are so stylized 	disgust	moviereview
2409	10501_1	Will no doubt delight Plympton 's legion of fans ; others may find 80 minutes of these shenanigans exhausting .	disgust	moviereview
4511	10502_1	The laughs are as rare as snake foo yung .	disgust	moviereview
14800	10503_1	 that celebrates radical , nonconformist values , What to Do in Case of Fire  	joy	moviereview
14823	10503_2	 For a film 	joy	moviereview

14844	10505_1	 who desperately want to be Quentin Tarantino when they grow up  	disgust	moviereview
14864	10505_2	 Knockaround Guys plays like a student film by two guys 	disgust	moviereview
8464	10506_1	But they lack their idol 's energy and passion for detail .	disgust	moviereview
2410	10507_1	Mattei so completely loses himself to the film 's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , Love in the Time of Money .	disgust	moviereview
24041	10508_1	  It briefly flirts with player masochism , 	disgust	moviereview
24042	10508_2	  but the point of real interest - -- audience sadism -- is evaded completely . 	disgust	moviereview
14885	10509_1	 and far less crass -  	joy	moviereview
14905	10509_2	 Holland lets things peter out midway  	disgust	moviereview
14947	10509_4	 , but it 's notably better  acted 	joy	moviereview
14966	10509_5	 than some other recent efforts in the burgeoning genre of films about black urban professionals .  	joy	moviereview
2749	1050_1	After making several adaptations of other writers ' work , Armenian-Canadian director Atom Egoyan broached an original treatment of a deeply personal subject .	joy	moviereview

21860	10512_2	  and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle . 	disgust	moviereview

15088	10513_2	 It 's unfortunate 	disgust	moviereview
15108	10514_1	 I would have liked it more if it had just gone that one step further  	disgust	moviereview
15125	10514_2	 I liked the movie , but I know 	joy	moviereview

8465	10518_1	-LRB- Jackson and Bledel -RRB- seem to have been picked not for their acting chops , but for their looks and appeal to the pre-teen crowd .	disgust	moviereview

25775	1051_1	  The film is painfully authentic , 	sadness	moviereview

24043	10520_1	  Like Schindler 's List , The Grey Zone attempts to be grandiloquent , 	disgust	moviereview
24044	10520_2	  but ends up merely pretentious -- in a grisly sort of way . 	disgust	moviereview
15184	10521_1	 why the DV revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film  	disgust	moviereview
15205	10521_2	 An unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of 	disgust	moviereview
25113	10522_1	  -LRB- Screenwriter -RRB- Pimental took the Farrelly Brothers comedy 	noemotion	moviereview
25114	10522_2	  and feminized it , 	noemotion	moviereview
25115	10522_3	  but it is a rather poor imitation . 	disgust	moviereview
15226	10523_1	 that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey  	disgust	moviereview
15246	10523_2	 It 's kind of sad 	sadness	moviereview
2413	10524_1	Friday After Next is a lot more bluster than bite .	disgust	moviereview
15268	10525_1	 will have you forever on the verge of either cracking up or throwing up  	disgust	moviereview
15288	10525_2	 Its juxtaposition of overwrought existentialism and stomach-churning gore 	disgust	moviereview
4513	10526_1	A decidedly mixed bag .	disgust	moviereview
21863	10527_1	  There are cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , 	disgust	moviereview
21864	10527_2	  and many tired jokes about men in heels . 	disgust	moviereview
24045	10528_1	  Ice Cube is n't quite out of ripe screwball ideas , 	disgust	moviereview
24046	10528_2	  but Friday After Next spreads them pretty thin . 	disgust	moviereview

18186	10647_1	 but Jonah ... never shakes the oppressive , morally superior good-for-you quality that almost automatically accompanies didactic entertainment  	disgust	moviereview
18209	10647_2	 The animation is competent , and some of the gags are quite funny , 	joy	moviereview
21913	10648_1	  The pace of the film is very slow -LRB- for obvious reasons -RRB- 	disgust	moviereview
21914	10648_2	  and that too becomes off-putting . 	disgust	moviereview
25120	10649_1	  Mr. Wollter 	noemotion	moviereview

2430	10655_1	Despite some comic sparks , Welcome to Collinwood never catches fire .	disgust	moviereview
25124	10656_1	  Director George Hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries , 	joy	moviereview

25126	10656_3	  and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad , 	disgust	moviereview
25127	10656_4	  and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place . 	disgust	moviereview
25128	10657_1	  Shows moments of promise 	disgust	moviereview

2431	10658_1	Even accepting this in the right frame of mind can only provide it with so much leniency .	disgust	moviereview

25131	10668_1	  I liked the original short story 	disgust	moviereview
25132	10668_2	  but this movie , even at an hour 	noemotion	moviereview
25133	10668_3	  and twenty-some minutes , it 's too long 	disgust	moviereview
25134	10668_4	  and it goes nowhere . 	disgust	moviereview

24055	10672_1	  Aspires to the cracked lunacy of The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai , 	joy	moviereview
24056	10672_2	  but thanks to an astonishingly witless script ends up more like The Adventures of Ford Fairlane . 	disgust	moviereview
21917	10673_1	  Real-life strongman Ahola lacks the charisma 	disgust	moviereview
21918	10673_2	  and ability to carry the film on his admittedly broad shoulders . 	disgust	moviereview
4537	10674_1	The title , alone , should scare any sane person away .	disgust	moviereview
2433	10675_1	Low comedy does n't come much lower .	disgust	moviereview
4538	10676_1	Appropriately cynical social commentary aside , # 9 never quite ignites .	disgust	moviereview
2434	10677_1	It 's crap on a leash -- far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of Joe Dante 's similarly styled Gremlins .	disgust	moviereview
13166	10678_1	 I can think of  	noemotion	moviereview
13189	10678_2	 One of the most depressing movie-going experiences 	disgust	moviereview
13212	10678_3	 is to sit through about 90 minutes of a so-called ` comedy ' and not laugh once .  	disgust	moviereview
13231	10679_1	 where the big scene is a man shot out of a cannon into a vat of ice cream  	noemotion	moviereview
13254	10679_2	 This is the kind of movie 	disgust	moviereview
25781	1067_1	  Highlights are the terrific performances by Christopher Plummer , as the prime villain , 	joy	moviereview

21919	10681_1	  A loud , brash 	disgust	moviereview
21920	10681_2	  and mainly unfunny high school comedy . 	disgust	moviereview
21921	10682_1	  An exceptionally dreary 	disgust	moviereview
21922	10682_2	  and overwrought bit of work , every bit as imperious as Katzenberg 's The Prince of Egypt from 1998 . 	disgust	moviereview
13319	10683_1	 that it even uses a totally unnecessary prologue , just because it seems obligatory  	disgust	moviereview
13339	10683_2	 The movie is so resolutely cobbled together out of older movies 	disgust	moviereview
13362	10684_1	 only a true believer could relish  	disgust	moviereview
13385	10684_2	 The movie 's vision of a white American zealously spreading a Puritanical brand of Christianity to South Seas islanders is one 	disgust	moviereview
13407	10685_1	 that it 's easier to change the sheets than to change hackneyed concepts when it comes to dreaming up romantic comedies  	disgust	moviereview
13428	10685_2	 Maid in Manhattan proves 	noemotion	moviereview
24057	10686_1	  A fairly harmless 	disgust	moviereview
24058	10686_2	  but ultimately lifeless feature-length afterschool special . 	disgust	moviereview
13449	10687_1	 I saw a movie where I wanted so badly for the protagonist to fail  	disgust	moviereview

21925	10696_1	  Cruel 	disgust	moviereview
21926	10696_2	  and inhuman cinematic punishment ... simultaneously degrades its characters , its stars 	disgust	moviereview
21927	10696_3	  and its audience . 	disgust	moviereview
21928	10697_1	  It 's not too fast 	joy	moviereview

21930	10698_1	  It 's not too racy 	disgust	moviereview

21932	10703_1	  We could have expected a little more human being , 	anticipation	moviereview
21933	10703_2	  and a little less product . 	noemotion	moviereview

13897	10714_1	 it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film  	disgust	moviereview
13918	10714_2	 The story of Trouble Every Day ... is so sketchy 	disgust	moviereview

2441	10715_1	A Movie to Forget	disgust	moviereview
21940	10716_1	  For all of its insights into the dream world of teen life , 	disgust	moviereview
21941	10716_2	  and its electronic expression through cyber culture , the film gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2 1/2 - hour running time . 	disgust	moviereview
4542	10717_1	Enough is not a bad movie , just mediocre .	disgust	moviereview
2442	10718_1	The performances are so overstated , the effect comes off as self-parody .	disgust	moviereview

17120	10859_1	 even fans of Sandler 's comic taste may find it uninteresting  	disgust	moviereview
17142	10859_2	 It 's definitely not made for kids or their parents , for that matter , and I think 	disgust	moviereview
3675	1085_1	It took 19 predecessors to get THIS ?	disgust	moviereview
21994	10860_1	  Sheridan seems terrified of the book 's irreverent energy , 	disgust	moviereview
21995	10860_2	  and scotches most of its lan , humor , bile , and irony .	disgust	moviereview
2464	10861_1	More busy than exciting , more frantic than involving , more chaotic than entertaining .	disgust	moviereview
17164	10862_1	 which hurts the overall impact of the film  	disgust	moviereview
17187	10862_2	 There are more shots of children smiling for the camera than typical documentary footage 	disgust	moviereview
2465	10863_1	It 's makes a better travelogue than movie .	disgust	moviereview
17210	10864_1	 It's as if Solondz had two ideas for two movies , could n't really figure out how to flesh either out , so he just slopped ` em together here  	disgust	moviereview
17253	10865_1	 that I 'll bet most parents had thought -- hoped 	anticipation	moviereview

17358	10867_1	 what once was conviction  	disgust	moviereview
17381	10867_2	 It 's a long way from Orwell 's dark , intelligent warning cry -LRB- 1984 -RRB- to the empty stud knockabout of Equilibrium , and 	disgust	moviereview
17402	10867_3	 is now affectation .  	joy	moviereview
24069	10868_1	  Its premise is smart , 	joy	moviereview
24070	10868_2	  but the execution is pretty weary . 	disgust	moviereview
2466	10869_1	The holiday message of the 37-minute Santa vs. the Snowman leaves a lot to be desired .	disgust	moviereview
25794	1086_1	  Thoughtful , even stinging at times , 	joy	moviereview
25795	1086_2	  and lots of fun . 	joy	moviereview

17509	10872_2	 -LRB- T -RRB- he script is n't up to the level of the direction , nor are the uneven performances by the cast members , 	disgust	moviereview

17610	10875_1	 Yet why it fails  	disgust	moviereview
17632	10875_2	 is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma .  	surprise	moviereview
4558	10876_1	Most of the characters come off as pantomimesque sterotypes .	disgust	moviereview
24071	10877_1	  Starts promisingly 	joy	moviereview
24072	10877_2	  but disintegrates into a dreary , humorless soap opera . 	disgust	moviereview
17652	10878_1	 While there 's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the Elizabethans -LRB- as well as rank frustration from those in the know about Rubbo 's dumbed-down tactics -RRB-  	disgust	moviereview
17675	10878_2	 , Much Ado About Something is an amicable endeavor .  	joy	moviereview
4559	10879_1	It 's actually too sincere -- the crime movie equivalent of a chick flick .	disgust	moviereview
3676	1087_1	One of the most haunting , viciously honest coming-of-age films in recent memory .	joy	moviereview
21996	10880_1	  Most of the film feels conceived 	joy	moviereview
21997	10880_2	  and shot on the fly -- like between lunch breaks for Shearer 's radio show 	disgust	moviereview
21998	10880_3	  and his Simpson voice-overs . 	disgust	moviereview
25144	10881_1	  Perry 's good 	disgust	moviereview
25145	10881_2	  and his is an interesting character , 	disgust	moviereview
25146	10881_3	  but `` Serving Sara '' has n't much more to serve than silly fluff . 	disgust	moviereview
4560	10882_1	Nor is it a romantic comedy .	noemotion	moviereview
17697	10883_1	 what is basically an anti-Harry Potter -- right down to the Gryffindor scarf  	disgust	moviereview
17720	10883_2	 Culkin turns his character into 	noemotion	moviereview
17740	10884_1	 that renders its tension flaccid  	disgust	moviereview
17762	10884_2	 Memorable for a peculiar malaise 	disgust	moviereview
17782	10884_3	 and , by extension , its surprises limp and its resolutions ritual .  	disgust	moviereview
17804	10885_1	 that says that the alternate sexuality meant to set you free may require so much relationship maintenance that celibacy can start looking good  	disgust	moviereview
17824	10885_2	 It 's a documentary 	noemotion	moviereview
2467	10886_1	In the not-too-distant future , movies like Ghost Ship will be used as analgesic balm for overstimulated minds .	disgust	moviereview
2468	10887_1	Right now , they 're merely signposts marking the slow , lingering death of imagination .	disgust	moviereview
17845	10888_1	 no respectable Halloween costume shop would ever try to sell  	disgust	moviereview
17865	10888_2	 The movie 's biggest shocks come from seeing former nymphette Juliette Lewis playing a salt-of-the-earth mommy named Minnie and watching Slim travel incognito in a ridiculous wig 	disgust	moviereview
4561	10889_1	Like most movies about the pitfalls of bad behavior ... Circuit gets drawn into the party .	disgust	moviereview
7796	1088_1	 who are never what they first appear  	joy	moviereview
7797	1088_2	 The WWII drama is well plotted , visually striking and filled with enjoyably complex characters 	joy	moviereview
17887	10890_1	 as if even the filmmakers did n't know what kind of movie they were making  	disgust	moviereview
17909	10890_2	 It appears 	noemotion	moviereview
21999	10891_1	  Beneath the uncanny , inevitable 	noemotion	moviereview
22000	10891_2	  and seemingly shrewd facade of movie-biz farce ... lies a plot cobbled together from largely flat 	disgust	moviereview
22001	10891_3	  and uncreative moments . 	disgust	moviereview
2469	10892_1	Snipes relies too much on a scorchingly plotted dramatic scenario for its own good .	disgust	moviereview
25147	10893_1	  Piccoli 's performance is amazing , yes , 	joy	moviereview
25148	10893_2	  but the symbols of loss 	noemotion	moviereview
25149	10893_3	  and denial 	disgust	moviereview
25150	10893_4	  and life-at-arm 's - length in the film seem irritatingly transparent . 	disgust	moviereview
22002	10894_1	  Starts out mediocre , spirals downward , 	disgust	moviereview
22003	10894_2	  and thuds to the bottom of the pool with an utterly incompetent conclusion . 	disgust	moviereview
17930	10895_1	 what is already an erratic career  	disgust	moviereview
17951	10895_2	 Nicolas Cage is n't the first actor to lead a group of talented friends astray , and this movie wo n't create a ruffle in 	disgust	moviereview
17991	10896_2	 It lacks the compassion , good-natured humor and the level of insight 	disgust	moviereview
18013	10896_3	 that made  -LRB- Eyre 's -RRB- first film something of a sleeper success .  	disgust	moviereview
4562	10897_1	The result is good gossip , entertainingly delivered , yet with a distinctly musty odour , its expiry date long gone .	disgust	moviereview
18034	10898_1	 that leaves scant place for the viewer  	disgust	moviereview
18056	10898_2	 A sustained fest of self-congratulation between actor and director 	disgust	moviereview
18078	10899_1	 That proves  	joy	moviereview
18101	10899_2	 that there is really only one movie 's worth of decent gags to be gleaned from the premise  	disgust	moviereview
18123	10899_3	 All Analyze 	disgust	moviereview

18164	10900_1	 while it 's not completely wreaked  	disgust	moviereview
18187	10900_2	 Green ruins every single scene he 's in , and the film , 	disgust	moviereview
18210	10900_3	 , is seriously compromised by that .  	disgust	moviereview
2470	10901_1	There 's not a comedic moment in this romantic comedy .	disgust	moviereview
22004	10902_1	  The story is predictable , the jokes are typical Sandler fare , 	disgust	moviereview
22005	10902_2	  and the romance with Ryder is puzzling . 	disgust	moviereview
2471	10903_1	Wallace directs with such patronising reverence , it turns the stomach .	disgust	moviereview
2472	10904_1	Resurrection has the dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad Blair Witch Project .	disgust	moviereview

18271	10906_1	 Pretend like your SAT scores are below 120 and you might not notice the flaws  	disgust	moviereview
18316	10907_1	 that the idea of exploiting molestation for laughs is funny , not actually exploiting it yourself  	disgust	moviereview
18336	10907_2	 Unlike Trey Parker , Sandler does n't understand 	disgust	moviereview
18358	10908_1	 that keeps telling you  	disgust	moviereview

22007	10911_2	  and psychologically unpersuasive , with an inconclusive ending . 	disgust	moviereview
18464	10912_1	 that is undercut by its awkward structure and a final veering toward melodrama  	disgust	moviereview

22008	10914_1	  A distinctly mixed bag , the occasional bursts of sharp writing alternating with lots of sloppiness 	disgust	moviereview
22009	10914_2	  and the obligatory moments of sentimental ooze . 	joy	moviereview
18504	10915_1	 What begins brightly  	disgust	moviereview

2476	10919_1	Feels like nothing quite so much as a middle-aged moviemaker 's attempt to surround himself with beautiful , half-naked women .	disgust	moviereview
25796	1091_1	  This time out , -LRB- Sade -RRB- is an unsettlingly familiar figure -- in turns loyal 	disgust	moviereview

13213	10920_2	 , the revelation fails to justify the build-up .  	disgust	moviereview
22010	10921_1	  This picture is murder by numbers , 	disgust	moviereview

974	10922_1	Hilarious musical comedy though stymied by accents thick as mud .	joy	moviereview

24073	10931_1	  A handsome 	disgust	moviereview
24074	10931_2	  but unfulfilling suspense drama more suited to a quiet evening on PBS than a night out at an AMC . 	disgust	moviereview

22016	10934_2	  and feels like three hours . 	disgust	moviereview
25151	10935_1	  A reworking of Die Hard 	disgust	moviereview
25152	10935_2	  and Cliffhanger 	disgust	moviereview
25153	10935_3	  but it 's nowhere near as exciting as either . 	disgust	moviereview
22017	10936_1	  Suffers from unlikable characters 	disgust	moviereview
22018	10936_2	  and a self-conscious sense of its own quirky hipness . 	disgust	moviereview

13622	10941_2	 It stars schticky Chris Rock and stolid Anthony Hopkins , 	disgust	moviereview
2479	10942_1	Their contrast is neither dramatic nor comic -- it 's just a weird fizzle .	disgust	moviereview
976	10943_1	This is a children 's film in the truest sense .	joy	moviereview

22021	10945_1	  Parents , on the other hand , will be ahead of the plot at all times , 	disgust	moviereview
22022	10945_2	  and there is n't enough clever innuendo to fil 	disgust	moviereview
22023	10946_1	  The niftiest trick perpetrated by The Importance of Being Earnest is the alchemical transmogrification of Wilde into Austen -- 	joy	moviereview

13642	10947_1	 Kieslowski 's work aspired to , including the condition of art  	joy	moviereview
13664	10947_2	 Tykwer 's surface flash is n't just a poor fit with Kieslowski 's lyrical pessimism ; it completely contradicts everything 	disgust	moviereview

13706	10948_2	 and that makes for some glacial pacing early on  	joy	moviereview

22025	10949_1	  Too slick 	disgust	moviereview
22026	10949_2	  and manufactured to claim street credibility . 	disgust	moviereview
3678	1094_1	It 's like a poem .	joy	moviereview
22027	10950_1	  Cherry Orchard is badly edited , often awkwardly directed 	disgust	moviereview
22028	10950_2	  and suffers from the addition of a wholly unnecessary pre-credit sequence designed to give some of the characters a ` back story . ' 	disgust	moviereview
13766	10951_1	 What ensues are much blood-splattering , mass drug-induced bowel evacuations , and none-too-funny commentary on the cultural distinctions between Americans and Brits  	disgust	moviereview
13809	10952_1	 that goes for sick and demented humor simply to do so  	disgust	moviereview
13830	10952_2	 A dark comedy 	disgust	moviereview
2480	10953_1	The movie is without intent .	disgust	moviereview

25155	10957_2	  and Hugh Grant make a great team , 	joy	moviereview
25156	10957_3	  but this predictable romantic comedy should get a pink slip . 	disgust	moviereview

14003	10958_2	 Allegiance to Chekhov , 	noemotion	moviereview
14026	10958_3	 , is a particularly vexing handicap .  	disgust	moviereview

22030	10959_2	  and screenwriter Nicholas Kazan -LRB- Reversal of Fortune -RRB- than this cliche pileup . 	disgust	moviereview

25801	1095_2	  and unselfconscious , 	joy	moviereview
25802	1095_3	  and Munch is a marvel of reality versus sappy sentiment . 	joy	moviereview
22031	10960_1	  The first mistake , I suspect , is casting Shatner as a legendary professor 	disgust	moviereview
22032	10960_2	  and Kunis as a brilliant college student -- where 's Pauly Shore as the rocket scientist ? 	disgust	moviereview
22033	10961_1	  The dramatic scenes are frequently unintentionally funny , 	disgust	moviereview

2506	11147_1	To call this film a lump of coal would only be to flatter it .	disgust	moviereview
4594	11148_1	Entertainment more disposable than Hanna-Barbera 's half-hour cartoons ever were .	disgust	moviereview
17568	11149_1	 that have made the original New Testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries  	disgust	moviereview
17590	11149_2	 The film falls short on tension , eloquence , spiritual challenge -- things 	disgust	moviereview
25813	1114_1	  Once again , director Jackson strikes a rewarding balance between emotion on the human scale 	joy	moviereview

2992	11152_1	It 's not an easy one to review .	noemotion	moviereview
4595	11153_1	At best this is a film for the under-7 crowd .	disgust	moviereview

22106	11192_1	  The movie is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise 	disgust	moviereview
22107	11192_2	  and consistent emotional conviction . 	disgust	moviereview
13191	11193_1	 that you 'd swear you  	disgust	moviereview
13214	11193_2	 Festers in just such a dungpile 	disgust	moviereview
13233	11193_3	 were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you .  	disgust	moviereview
13256	11194_1	 just how far his storytelling skills have eroded  	disgust	moviereview
13278	11194_2	 Lyne 's latest , the erotic thriller Unfaithful , further demonstrates 	disgust	moviereview
13299	11195_1	 how it plays out  	disgust	moviereview
13321	11195_2	 It sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss , and that 's more or less 	disgust	moviereview
2512	11196_1	Rumor , a muddled drama about coming to terms with death , feels impersonal , almost generic .	disgust	moviereview
2513	11197_1	Report card : Does n't live up to the exalted tagline - there 's definite room for improvement .	disgust	moviereview
2514	11198_1	Does n't deserve a passing grade -LRB- even on a curve -RRB- .	disgust	moviereview
22108	11199_1	  The pacing is deadly , the narration helps little 	disgust	moviereview
22109	11199_2	  and Naipaul , a juicy writer , is negated . 	disgust	moviereview
7819	1119_1	 is probably  	disgust	moviereview
7820	1119_2	 No one goes unindicted here , which 	disgust	moviereview
24310	111_1	  On the surface , it 's a lovers-on-the-run crime flick , 	noemotion	moviereview
24311	111_2	  but it has a lot in common with Piesiewicz 's 	noemotion	moviereview
24312	111_3	  and Kieslowski 's earlier work , films like The Double Life of Veronique . 	noemotion	moviereview
13341	11200_1	 As his circle of friends keeps getting smaller  	noemotion	moviereview
13364	11200_2	 one of the characters in Long Time Dead says ` I 'm telling you , this is f *** ed ' .  	noemotion	moviereview
2995	11201_1	Maybe he was reading the minds of the audience .	noemotion	moviereview
13387	11202_1	 if it had been only half-an-hour long or a TV special  	noemotion	moviereview
13430	11202_3	 , the humor would have been fast and furious -- at ninety minutes , it drags .  	disgust	moviereview
2515	11203_1	Bean drops the ball too many times ... hoping the nifty premise will create enough interest to make up for an unfocused screenplay .	disgust	moviereview
24093	11204_1	  A well-acted , 	joy	moviereview
24094	11204_2	  but one-note film . 	disgust	moviereview
13451	11205_1	 with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from Eastwood 's Dirty Harry period  	disgust	moviereview
13471	11205_2	 Blood Work is laughable in the solemnity 	disgust	moviereview
2516	11206_1	The movie is too amateurishly square to make the most of its own ironic implications .	disgust	moviereview
13494	11207_1	 the same way that Jim Brown treats his women -- as dumb , credulous , unassuming , subordinate subjects  	disgust	moviereview
13515	11207_2	 -LRB- Lee -RRB- treats his audience 	disgust	moviereview
4599	11208_1	And Lee seems just as expectant of an adoring , wide-smiling reception .	joy	moviereview
22110	11209_1	  There 's not one decent performance from the cast 	disgust	moviereview
22111	11209_2	  and not one clever line of dialogue . 	disgust	moviereview
7821	1120_1	 And if you 're not nearly moved to tears by a couple of scenes  	sadness	moviereview
7822	1120_2	 you 've got ice water in your veins . 	joy	moviereview
22112	11210_1	  No amount of burning , blasting , stabbing , 	disgust	moviereview
22113	11210_2	  and shooting can hide a weak script . 	disgust	moviereview
2517	11211_1	It 's an odd show , pregnant with moods , stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise .	disgust	moviereview
13536	11212_1	 for granted in most films are mishandled here  	disgust	moviereview
13557	11212_2	 Nearly all the fundamentals you take 	disgust	moviereview
22114	11213_1	  The Armenian genocide deserves a more engaged 	disgust	moviereview
22115	11213_2	  and honest treatment . 	disgust	moviereview
22116	11214_1	  Earnest yet curiously tepid 	disgust	moviereview
22117	11214_2	  and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner . 	disgust	moviereview
22118	11215_1	  Ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of Louis Begley 's source novel -LRB- About Schmidt -RRB- 	disgust	moviereview
22119	11215_2	  and an old Payne screenplay . 	disgust	moviereview
2518	11216_1	The exploitative , clumsily staged violence overshadows everything , including most of the actors .	disgust	moviereview
22120	11217_1	  We started to wonder if ... some unpaid intern had just typed ` Chris Rock , ' ` Anthony Hopkins ' 	disgust	moviereview
22121	11217_2	  and ` terrorists ' into some Univac-like script machine . 	disgust	moviereview
13579	11218_1	 Even when Crush departs from the 4W formula  	disgust	moviereview
13600	11218_2	 ... it feels like a glossy rehash .  	disgust	moviereview
2519	11219_1	More likely to have you scratching your head than hiding under your seat .	disgust	moviereview
157	1121_1	A warm , funny , engaging film .	joy	moviereview
13623	11220_1	 than I imagined a movie ever could be  	disgust	moviereview
13643	11220_2	 Bears is even worse 	disgust	moviereview
13665	11221_1	 When you find yourself rooting for the monsters in a horror movie  	disgust	moviereview
13707	11221_3	 , you know 	disgust	moviereview
2520	11222_1	This is very much of a mixed bag , with enough negatives to outweigh the positives .	disgust	moviereview
22122	11223_1	  Marinated in clichs 	disgust	moviereview
22123	11223_2	  and mawkish dialogue . 	disgust	moviereview
13726	11224_1	 Whether it 's the worst movie of 2002  	disgust	moviereview
13745	11224_2	 , I ca n't say for sure : Memories of Rollerball have faded , and I skipped Country Bears .  	disgust	moviereview
8470	11225_1	But this new jangle of noise , mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title .	disgust	moviereview
13767	11226_1	 that strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain  	disgust	moviereview
13788	11226_2	 -LRB- A -RRB- boldly stroked , luridly coloured , uni-dimensional nonsense machine 	disgust	moviereview
13810	11227_1	 I become very involved in the proceedings  	disgust	moviereview
13831	11227_2	 Not once in the rush to save the day did 	noemotion	moviereview
13854	11227_3	 ; to me , it was just a matter of ` eh . '  	disgust	moviereview
13877	11228_1	 and worse  than you can imagine  	disgust	moviereview
13899	11228_2	 Rollerball IS as bad as you think  	disgust	moviereview
13961	11229_1	 why Anthony Hopkins is in it  	disgust	moviereview
13983	11229_2	 The first question to ask about Bad Company is 	disgust	moviereview
25815	1122_1	  Uses sharp humor 	joy	moviereview
25816	1122_2	  and insight into human nature to examine class conflict , adolescent yearning , the roots of friendship 	joy	moviereview
25817	1122_3	  and sexual identity . 	noemotion	moviereview
14004	11230_1	 he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce , because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low  	disgust	moviereview
14027	11230_2	 We assume 	disgust	moviereview
2521	11231_1	Not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general .	disgust	moviereview
2522	11232_1	It merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them .	disgust	moviereview
22124	11233_1	  Shame on writer/director Vicente Aranda for making a florid biopic about mad queens , obsessive relationships , 	disgust	moviereview
22125	11233_2	  and rampant adultery so dull . 	disgust	moviereview
2523	11234_1	Suffers from a decided lack of creative storytelling .	disgust	moviereview
22126	11235_1	  Violent , vulgar 	disgust	moviereview
22127	11235_2	  and forgettably entertaining . 	joy	moviereview
22128	11236_1	  Nothing happens , 	noemotion	moviereview
22129	11236_2	  and it happens to flat characters . 	disgust	moviereview
14049	11237_1	 that you 've seen it all before , even if you 've never come within a mile of The Longest Yard  	disgust	moviereview
14070	11237_2	 With a completely predictable plot , you 'll swear 	disgust	moviereview
14091	11238_1	 when thrillers actually thrilled  	disgust	moviereview
14113	11238_2	 Remember back 	disgust	moviereview
4600	11239_1	When the twist endings were actually surprising ?	surprise	moviereview
1547	1123_1	Half Submarine flick , Half Ghost Story , All in one criminally neglected film	disgust	moviereview
2996	11240_1	When the violence actually shocked ?	noemotion	moviereview
4601	11241_1	When the heroes were actually under 40 ?	noemotion	moviereview
14136	11242_1	 Sadly , as Blood Work proves  	sadness	moviereview
14181	11242_3	 , that was a long , long time ago .  	sadness	moviereview
14200	11243_1	 that gives pic its title an afterthought  	joy	moviereview
14223	11243_2	 Blue Crush has all the trappings of an energetic , extreme-sports adventure , but ends up more of a creaky `` Pretty Woman '' retread , with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing 	disgust	moviereview
2524	11244_1	This movie plays like an extended dialogue exercise in Retard 101 .	disgust	moviereview
14245	11245_1	 What we get in FearDotCom  	disgust	moviereview
14267	11245_2	 is more like something from a bad Clive Barker movie .  	disgust	moviereview
2525	11246_1	In other words , it 's badder than bad .	disgust	moviereview
14287	11247_1	 it might have held my attention  	disgust	moviereview
14330	11247_3	 If they broke out into elaborate choreography  	noemotion	moviereview
14353	11247_4	 , singing and finger snapping 	disgust	moviereview
14395	11247_6	  but as it stands I kept looking for the last exit from Brooklyn .  	disgust	moviereview
22130	11248_1	  A sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare like The Ghost 	disgust	moviereview
22131	11248_2	  and Mr. Chicken . 	disgust	moviereview
4602	11249_1	A small independent film suffering from a severe case of Hollywood-itis .	disgust	moviereview
158	1124_1	Entertains by providing good , lively company .	joy	moviereview
14417	11250_1	 Where the film falters is in its tone 	disgust	moviereview
2526	11251_1	The story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head .	disgust	moviereview
14461	11252_1	 that one woman 's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness  	disgust	moviereview
14484	11252_2	 Ultimately , Sarah 's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic , and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case 	disgust	moviereview
14505	11253_1	 how hope can breed a certain kind of madness -- and strength  	disgust	moviereview
14527	11253_2	 It 's supposed to be a humorous , all-too-human look at 	joy	moviereview
14547	11253_3	 -- but it never quite adds up .  	disgust	moviereview
2527	11254_1	Feels more like a rejected X-Files episode than a credible account of a puzzling real-life happening .	disgust	moviereview
14567	11255_1	 ultimate thrills  	joy	moviereview
14587	11255_2	 Some motion pictures portray ultimate passion ; others create 	joy	moviereview
2528	11256_1	Men in Black II achieves ultimate insignificance -- it 's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as Whiffle-Ball epic .	disgust	moviereview
14609	11257_1	 that 's too clever for its own good  	disgust	moviereview
14630	11257_2	 An enigmatic film 	joy	moviereview
14653	11257_3	 , it 's a conundrum not worth solving .  	disgust	moviereview
2529	11258_1	A zombie movie in every sense of the word -- mindless , lifeless , meandering , loud , painful , obnoxious .	disgust	moviereview
14675	11259_1	 that clearly means to preach exclusively to the converted 	disgust	moviereview
14696	11259_2	 A film 	disgust	moviereview
7823	1125_1	 Dazzles with its fully-written characters , its determined stylishness -LRB- 	joy	moviereview
7824	1125_2	 always relates to characters and story -RRB- and Johnny Dankworth 's best soundtrack in years . 	joy	moviereview
14740	11260_1	 that this is a Mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that  	disgust	moviereview
14760	11260_2	 It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out 	disgust	moviereview
24095	11261_1	  Definitely a crowd-pleaser , 	joy	moviereview
24096	11261_2	  but then , so was the Roman Colosseum . 	joy	moviereview
24097	11262_1	  Certainly not a good movie , 	disgust	moviereview
24098	11262_2	  but it was n't horrible either . 	disgust	moviereview
14782	11263_1	 Although it starts off so bad that you feel like running out screaming  	disgust	moviereview
14803	11263_2	 , it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful .  	disgust	moviereview
14825	11264_1	 that even slightly wised-up kids would quickly change the channel  	disgust	moviereview
14845	11264_2	 The result is so tame 	disgust	moviereview
14867	11265_1	 the filmmakers could dredge up  	disgust	moviereview
14887	11265_2	 It appears to have been modeled on the worst revenge-of-the-nerds clichs 	disgust	moviereview
24099	11266_1	  Nothing 	noemotion	moviereview
24100	11266_2	  but an episode of Smackdown ! 	disgust	moviereview
22132	11267_1	  in period costume 	joy	moviereview
22133	11267_2	  and with a bigger budget . 	noemotion	moviereview
14908	11268_1	 it 's surprisingly old-fashioned  	surprise	moviereview
14929	11268_2	 It takes you somewhere you 're not likely to have seen before , but beneath the exotic surface -LRB- and exotic dancing -RRB- 	joy	moviereview
14950	11269_1	 While the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible Anne Rice novel it 's based upon  	joy	moviereview
14968	11269_2	 , Queen Of The Damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle .  	disgust	moviereview
25818	1126_1	  Visually imaginative , thematically instructive 	joy	moviereview
25819	1126_2	  and thoroughly delightful , it takes us on a roller-coaster ride from innocence to experience without even a hint of that typical kiddie-flick sentimentality . 	joy	moviereview
2530	11270_1	It should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring .	disgust	moviereview
25179	11271_1	  A good-looking 	joy	moviereview
25180	11271_2	  but ultimately pointless political thriller with plenty of action 	disgust	moviereview
25181	11271_3	  and almost no substance . 	disgust	moviereview
2531	11272_1	A tired , predictable , bordering on offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid .	disgust	moviereview
14989	11273_1	 it 's because there 's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair  	disgust	moviereview
15010	11273_2	 If Hill is n't quite his generation 's Don Siegel -LRB- or Robert Aldrich -RRB-  	disgust	moviereview
15050	11273_4	 ; it 's all bluster and clich .  	disgust	moviereview
15071	11274_1	 as it is repetitious  	disgust	moviereview
15091	11274_2	 Stealing Harvard will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : A few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin 	disgust	moviereview
22134	11275_1	  This is an insultingly inept 	disgust	moviereview
22135	11275_2	  and artificial examination of grief 	disgust	moviereview
22136	11275_3	  and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors . 	disgust	moviereview
15111	11276_1	 Does anyone much think the central story of Brendan Behan is 	noemotion	moviereview
15128	11276_2	 that he was a bisexual sweetheart before he took to drink  	joy	moviereview
15187	11277_1	 ` Martin Lawrence Live ' is so self-pitying  	disgust	moviereview
15228	11277_3	 , I almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show .  	disgust	moviereview
22137	11278_1	  The dialogue is cumbersome , the simpering soundtrack 	disgust	moviereview
22138	11278_2	  and editing more so . 	disgust	moviereview
15249	11279_1	 whether it wants to be a black comedy , drama , melodrama or some combination of the three  	disgust	moviereview
15271	11279_2	 Never decides 	disgust	moviereview
159	1127_1	Nothing 's at stake , just a twisty double-cross you can smell a mile away -- still , the derivative Nine Queens is lots of fun .	joy	moviereview
15291	11280_1	 that the franchise 's best years are long past  	disgust	moviereview
15313	11280_2	 It has become apparent 	disgust	moviereview
15333	11281_1	 Does what should seem impossible  	surprise	moviereview
15374	11281_3	 : it makes serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer boring .  	disgust	moviereview

15416	11282_2	 Do n't hate El Crimen del Padre Amaro 	disgust	moviereview
15437	11283_1	 Hate it because it 's lousy  	anger	moviereview

15479	11285_1	 they 're struggling to create  	disgust	moviereview
15501	11285_2	 Like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art 	disgust	moviereview
15521	11286_1	 they do n't understand  	disgust	moviereview
15541	11286_2	 ones they figure the power-lunchers do n't care to understand , either  	disgust	moviereview
15563	11286_3	 The filmmakers are playing to the Big Boys in New York and L.A. To that end , they mock the kind of folks 	disgust	moviereview
24101	11287_1	  Competently directed 	joy	moviereview
24102	11287_2	  but terminally cute drama . 	joy	moviereview
22139	11288_1	  The big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair 	disgust	moviereview
22140	11288_2	  and then biting into it 	disgust	moviereview
22141	11288_3	  and finding the filling missing . 	disgust	moviereview
4604	11289_1	Not just unlikable .	disgust	moviereview
25820	1128_1	  Unlike the speedy wham-bam effect of most Hollywood offerings , character development -- 	disgust	moviereview
25821	1128_2	  and more importantly , character empathy -- is at the heart of Italian for Beginners . 	joy	moviereview
4605	11290_1	Disturbing .	fear	moviereview

2535	11299_1	In terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused .	disgust	moviereview
25822	1129_1	  You 'll gasp appalled 	disgust	moviereview

18189	11417_2	 One key problem with these ardently Christian storylines is 	disgust	moviereview
22190	11418_1	  Essentially , the film is weak on detail 	joy	moviereview
22191	11418_2	  and strong on personality 	joy	moviereview
22192	11419_1	  A relentless , bombastic 	disgust	moviereview
22193	11419_2	  and ultimately empty World War II action flick . 	disgust	moviereview
7839	1141_1	 It moves quickly , adroitly , and without fuss ;	joy	moviereview

22196	11422_1	  Leaves viewers out in the cold 	disgust	moviereview
22197	11422_2	  and undermines some phenomenal performances . 	disgust	moviereview
2559	11423_1	... a ho-hum affair , always watchable yet hardly memorable .	disgust	moviereview
22198	11424_1	  Swiftly deteriorates into a terribly obvious melodrama 	disgust	moviereview
22199	11424_2	  and rough-hewn vanity project for lead actress Andie MacDowell . 	disgust	moviereview
22200	11425_1	  The histrionic muse still eludes Madonna 	disgust	moviereview
22201	11425_2	  and , playing a charmless witch , she is merely a charmless witch . 	disgust	moviereview

8298	1142_1	A deep and meaningful film .	joy	moviereview
24115	11430_1	  A technically well-made suspenser ... 	joy	moviereview
24116	11430_2	  but its abrupt drop in IQ points as it races to the finish line proves simply too discouraging to let slide . 	disgust	moviereview
2561	11431_1	An inept , tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more .	disgust	moviereview
18360	11432_1	 how the movie could be released in this condition  	disgust	moviereview
18381	11432_2	 It 's a mystery 	disgust	moviereview

22204	11438_1	  ` Dragonfly ' dwells on crossing-over mumbo jumbo , manipulative sentimentality , 	disgust	moviereview
22205	11438_2	  and sappy dialogue . 	disgust	moviereview
8472	11439_1	In his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter , Silberling also , to a certain extent , trivializes the movie with too many nervous gags and pratfalls .	disgust	moviereview
25829	1143_1	  The film 's welcome breeziness 	joy	moviereview
25830	1143_2	  and some unbelievably hilarious moments -- most portraying the idiocy of the film industry -- make it mostly worth the trip . 	joy	moviereview

25185	11440_2	  and charismatic star , 	joy	moviereview

13169	11446_2	 If A Few Good Men told us that we `` ca n't handle the truth '' than High Crimes  	disgust	moviereview
13192	11446_3	 poetically states at one point in this movie 	disgust	moviereview
13234	11447_1	 that Tom Tykwer , director of the resonant and sense-spinning Run Lola Run , has turned out to be a one-trick pony  	disgust	moviereview
13257	11447_2	 Further sad evidence 	disgust	moviereview
13279	11447_3	 -- a maker of softheaded metaphysical claptrap .  	disgust	moviereview

13322	11448_2	 You 'll trudge out of the theater feeling 	disgust	moviereview
2566	11449_1	The movie is a little tired ; maybe the original inspiration has run its course .	disgust	moviereview
25831	1144_1	  It 's a remarkably solid 	joy	moviereview
25832	1144_2	  and subtly satirical tour de force . 	joy	moviereview
13342	11450_1	 as there are moviegoers anxious to see strange young guys doing strange guy things  	joy	moviereview
13365	11450_2	 This will go on so long 	disgust	moviereview
2567	11451_1	A full-frontal attack on audience patience .	disgust	moviereview
13388	11452_1	 less sophisticated audiences will mistake it for an endorsement of the very things that Bean abhors  	disgust	moviereview
13409	11452_2	 Any intellectual arguments being made about the nature of God are framed in a drama so clumsy , there is a real danger 	disgust	moviereview
8473	11453_1	It 's a big idea , but the film itself is small and shriveled .	disgust	moviereview
2568	11454_1	Debut effort by `` Project Greenlight '' winner is sappy and amateurish .	disgust	moviereview
13431	11455_1	 One gets the impression the creators of Do n't Ask Do n't Tell 	disgust	moviereview
13472	11455_3	 laughed a hell of a lot at their own jokes .  	disgust	moviereview
2569	11456_1	Too bad none of it is funny .	disgust	moviereview
24117	11457_1	  The cast has a high time , 	joy	moviereview
24118	11457_2	  but de Broca has little enthusiasm for such antique pulp . 	disgust	moviereview
2570	11458_1	The film , like Jimmy 's routines , could use a few good laughs .	disgust	moviereview
13495	11459_1	 where it 's on slippery footing  	disgust	moviereview
13516	11459_2	 that 's especially fit for the kiddies  	joy	moviereview
13537	11459_3	 The film has too many spots 	disgust	moviereview

161	1145_1	Enormously entertaining for moviegoers of any age .	joy	moviereview
13580	11460_1	 that should be the target of something deeper and more engaging  	disgust	moviereview
13601	11460_2	 Purports to be a Hollywood satire but winds up as the kind of film 	disgust	moviereview

13624	11462_1	 who do n't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes  	disgust	moviereview
13644	11462_2	 ... in the pile of useless actioners from MTV schmucks 	disgust	moviereview
13666	11463_1	 Though it was made with careful attention to detail and is well-acted by James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal  	joy	moviereview

2571	11464_1	Humor in I Spy is so anemic .	disgust	moviereview

13727	11466_2	 , Mr. Shyamalan is undone by his pretensions .  	disgust	moviereview
13746	11467_1	 While the new film is much more eye-catching than its blood-drenched Stephen Norrington-directed predecessor 	disgust	moviereview
13768	11467_2	 the new script by the returning David  S. Goyer is much sillier .  	disgust	moviereview
22206	11468_1	  In addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history , Ballistic : Ecks Vs. Sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters 	disgust	moviereview
22207	11468_2	  and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase . 	disgust	moviereview
25187	11469_1	  It shares the first two films ' loose-jointed structure , 	disgust	moviereview
25188	11469_2	  but laugh-out-loud bits are few 	disgust	moviereview
25189	11469_3	  and far between . 	disgust	moviereview
162	1146_1	A poignant , artfully crafted meditation on mortality .	joy	moviereview

13811	11470_2	 The Santa Clause 2 is a barely adequate babysitter for older kids , but I 've got to give 	disgust	moviereview

13855	11471_2	 You can not guess 	disgust	moviereview
13878	11472_1	 the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull  	disgust	moviereview
13900	11472_2	 Barney throws away the goodwill 	disgust	moviereview

13962	11474_1	 We get the comedy we settle for  	disgust	moviereview
25190	11475_1	  The uneven movie does have its charms 	disgust	moviereview
25191	11475_2	  and its funny moments 	joy	moviereview
25192	11475_3	  but not quite enough of them . 	disgust	moviereview
22208	11476_1	  Two hours of sepia-tinted heavy metal images 	noemotion	moviereview

984	11487_1	Still , the updated Dickensian sensibility of writer Craig Bartlett 's story is appealing .	joy	moviereview
14092	11488_1	 that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at  	disgust	moviereview
14114	11488_2	 True to its title , it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations 	disgust	moviereview
14137	11489_1	 that surrounded its debut at the Sundance Film Festival two years ago  	noemotion	moviereview
14159	11489_2	 Does n't come close to justifying the hype 	disgust	moviereview
23276	1148_1	  Not only is Undercover Brother as funny , if not more so , than both Austin Powers films , 	joy	moviereview
23277	1148_2	  but it 's also one of the smarter , savvier spoofs to come along in some time . 	joy	moviereview
22212	11490_1	  The plot is paper-thin 	disgust	moviereview
22213	11490_2	  and the characters are n't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours . 	disgust	moviereview
22214	11491_1	  Kaufman 's script is never especially clever 	disgust	moviereview
22215	11491_2	  and often is rather pretentious . 	disgust	moviereview

14310	11495_2	 Any film 	disgust	moviereview
14331	11495_3	 is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss .  	disgust	moviereview
14354	11496_1	 that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves  	disgust	moviereview
14375	11496_2	 ... Blade II is still top-heavy with blazing guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts , disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves 	disgust	moviereview

14440	11498_1	 Though there are many tense scenes in Trapped  	disgust	moviereview
14462	11498_2	 , they prove more distressing than suspenseful .  	disgust	moviereview
22216	11499_1	  In this film we at least see a study in contrasts ; the wide range of one actor , 	joy	moviereview

7843	1149_1	 allow it in  	noemotion	moviereview
7844	1149_2	 In a way , the film feels like a breath of fresh air , but only to those that 	joy	moviereview
6928	114_1	 operates by the rules of its own self-contained universe  	joy	moviereview
6929	114_2	 A romantic comedy that 	noemotion	moviereview
2574	11500_1	Feels strangely hollow at its emotional core .	disgust	moviereview
14485	11501_1	 where director Adrian Lyne holds sway  	disgust	moviereview
14506	11501_2	 where all relationships are simultaneously broadly metaphorical , oddly abstract , and excruciatingly literal  	disgust	moviereview
14528	11501_3	 You have once again entered the bizarre realm 	disgust	moviereview
22218	11502_1	  The high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , 	disgust	moviereview
22219	11502_2	  and truth-in-advertising hounds take note : There 's very little hustling on view . 	disgust	moviereview
14568	11503_1	 which adds 51 minutes  	noemotion	moviereview
14588	11503_2	 This director 's cut -- 	noemotion	moviereview

2575	11504_1	Characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle .	disgust	moviereview
14631	11505_1	 like `` si , pretty much '' and `` por favor , go home '' when talking to Americans  	noemotion	moviereview
14654	11505_2	 the Venezuelans say things 	noemotion	moviereview
24119	11506_1	  That 's muy loco , 	disgust	moviereview
24120	11506_2	  but no more ridiculous than most of the rest of `` Dragonfly . '' 	disgust	moviereview
14676	11507_1	 that ends with Truckzilla  	disgust	moviereview
14697	11507_2	 It 's a movie 	noemotion	moviereview

14783	11509_1	 who needs to heal himself  	disgust	moviereview
14804	11509_2	 Director Tom Shadyac and star Kevin Costner glumly mishandle the story 's promising premise of a physician 	disgust	moviereview
29959	1150_1	 Woody Allen 's latest is an ambling , broad comedy about all there is to love -- and hate -- about the movie biz . 	joy	moviereview
22220	11510_1	  It 's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting 	disgust	moviereview
22221	11510_2	  and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 . 	disgust	moviereview
8474	11511_1	Like the Tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on	disgust	moviereview
4629	11512_1	As pedestrian as they come .	disgust	moviereview
14826	11513_1	 that plays things so nice  'n safe 	disgust	moviereview
14846	11513_2	 as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week  	disgust	moviereview
14868	11513_3	 A film 	disgust	moviereview
14909	11513_5	 blown up for the big screen .  	noemotion	moviereview
14930	11514_1	 that throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer 's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary  	disgust	moviereview
14951	11514_2	 It 's a feel-bad ending for a depressing story 	sadness	moviereview
22222	11515_1	  Put it somewhere between Sling Blade 	noemotion	moviereview
22223	11515_2	  and South of Heaven , West of Hell in the pantheon of Billy Bob 's body of work . 	joy	moviereview
1498	11516_1	More intellectually scary than dramatically involving .	fear	moviereview
2576	11517_1	An inconsequential , barely there bit of piffle .	disgust	moviereview

2577	11519_1	As saccharine as it is disposable .	disgust	moviereview
163	1151_1	It 's a stunning lyrical work of considerable force and truth .	joy	moviereview
15011	11520_1	 but that she has n't been worth caring about  	disgust	moviereview
15031	11520_2	 that Kate is n't very bright  	disgust	moviereview
15051	11520_3	 and that maybe she , Janine and Molly -- an all-woman dysfunctional family -- deserve one another  	disgust	moviereview
15072	11520_4	 You come away thinking not only 	disgust	moviereview
24121	11521_1	  The metaphors are provocative , 	disgust	moviereview
24122	11521_2	  but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery . 	disgust	moviereview
15129	11522_1	 that it appears not to have been edited at all .  	disgust	moviereview
15149	11522_2	 Very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose 	disgust	moviereview
4630	11523_1	Too much power , not enough puff .	disgust	moviereview
15167	11524_1	 that the movie has virtually nothing to show  	disgust	moviereview
15188	11524_2	 The attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact 	fear	moviereview
15208	11525_1	 that Hitler 's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances  	disgust	moviereview

19635	13163_2	 It 's been a solid half year 	joy	blog
19646	13163_3	 , and I will now attempt to encapsulate the last six months into one last epic email .  	noemotion	blog
19655	13164_1	 I believe it was April  	noemotion	blog
19676	13164_3	 , and spring had just arrived .  	noemotion	blog
19686	13165_1	 I 'll start my narrative with a little anecdote about how small the world really is  	noemotion	blog
19697	13165_2	 so I was going to work one day 	noemotion	blog
19708	13165_3	 headed to one of the hostels around Berlin to pick people up for the tour 	noemotion	blog
19715	13165_4	 and then bring them back to the Brandenburg Gate where the tour starts 	noemotion	blog
19724	13166_1	 and  as I entered and gave my little spiel about the tour and asked if anyone wanted to come along  	noemotion	blog
19734	13166_2	 I had never been to this particular hostel before 	noemotion	blog
19742	13166_3	 , I was met not with a roar of enthusiasm from the hostel residents , but rather a few dull , glass-eyed looks and was generally ignored .  	joy	blog
19751	13167_1	 As I was preparing to leave  	noemotion	blog
19759	13167_2	 , one guy over at the computers yelled out for me to wait , approached me and said hello .  	surprise	blog
19769	13168_1	 when I was  	noemotion	blog
19779	13168_2	 He had arrived twenty minutes beforehand at the hostel , had n't even checked in yet , and just happened to be in the lobby 	noemotion	blog
22344	13169_1	  We had a great time catching up , 	joy	blog
22345	13169_2	  and went out that night together as well . 	noemotion	blog
25904	1316_1	  The movie is n't just hilarious : It 's witty 	joy	moviereview
25905	1316_2	  and inventive , too , 	joy	moviereview
25906	1316_3	  and in hindsight , it is n't even all that dumb . 	joy	moviereview
19788	13170_1	 how you randomly run in to people you have n't seen in years , in little hole-in-the-walls in Europe  	noemotion	blog
19797	13170_2	 But it 's certainly strange 	noemotion	blog
22346	13171_1	  The rest of April passed rather uneventfully , 	noemotion	blog
22347	13171_2	  and in May I went to see a production of Faust Part I at the Deutsches Theater . 	noemotion	blog
19806	13172_1	 I have EVER seen  	joy	blog
19816	13172_2	 And this particular piece was by far the best play 	joy	blog
5164	13173_1	It was also incredibly simple, cutting the normally huge cast down to only seven performers.	joy	blog
19824	13174_1	 that that remind me why I 've chosen theatre as a profession  	joy	blog
19831	13174_2	 It 's moments like 	joy	blog
19841	13175_1	 I took to London at the end of May  	anticipation	blog

19859	13175_3	 . I had never been before , and had been planning on this trip for about six months .  	anticipation	blog
22348	13176_1	  I was lucky enough to be able to stay with some friends to cut down on the cost , 	joy	blog
22349	13176_2	  and see a different side of London life . 	joy	blog
22350	13177_1	  I saw most of the major sites on my own , 	noemotion	blog
22351	13177_2	  and I went to the theater almost every night I was there . 	noemotion	blog
2688	13178_1	The show was trash.	disgust	blog
2689	13179_1	Horribly acted, horribly directed, weak script.	disgust	blog
191	1317_1	Old-form moviemaking at its best .	joy	moviereview
2690	13180_1	And interminably long.	disgust	blog

19876	13181_2	 I wanted to leave at intermission , but my date was really enjoying 	disgust	blog
19886	13182_1	 I took from it was that I know now that the British are just as capable as we are of producing really awful work  	disgust	blog
19894	13182_2	 I guess the one good thing 	joy	blog
19903	13183_1	 that , just wish I did n't have to experience it first hand  	disgust	blog
19912	13183_2	 It was nice to understand 	joy	blog
22352	13184_1	  The performers were incredible , 	joy	blog
22353	13184_2	  and one of the generals was played by Geoffrey , the butler from Fresh Prince of Bellaire . 	joy	blog
22354	13185_1	  That in itself was hilarious , 	joy	blog
22355	13185_2	  and made us love the show even more . 	joy	blog
22356	13186_1	  I also saw Les Miserables for the first time , 	joy	blog
22357	13186_2	  and it was fun . 	joy	blog
19920	13187_1	 they were donated by New Zealand  	noemotion	blog
19929	13187_2	 And the funniest part , the two statues said 	joy	blog

19939	13189_1	 before the World Cup began I had actually never seen an entire soccer game from start to finish  	noemotion	blog
19948	13189_2	 Now I have a confession to make : 	noemotion	blog
192	1318_1	Ahhhh ... revenge is sweet !	joy	moviereview
19956	13190_1	 , for instance there was a three day period where we had over 90,000 Swedes in the city , leading up to their dramatic defeat at the hands of Zeh Germans  	noemotion	blog
19965	13190_2	 The hordes of people would change from day to day 	noemotion	blog
22358	13191_1	  Then there were the Brazilians , everywhere , singing-clapping-dancing-taking pictures , 	joy	blog
22359	13191_2	  and of course the pale 	noemotion	blog
22360	13191_3	  and pasty Brits with their cock-eyed stares 	disgust	blog
22361	13191_4	  and drinking songs . 	joy	blog
19974	13192_1	 that was playing to watch the match  	noemotion	blog
19984	13192_2	 I did n't have tickets to any of the games , but my group of friends would always go to a cafe or bar of the nationality 	noemotion	blog
19992	13193_1	 when Spain played  	noemotion	blog
20002	13193_2	 So to a French cafe for the France-Swiss game , a Tapas bar 	noemotion	blog
20011	13193_3	 , drank Caiprinhas with the passionate Brazilians , etc. . It was a colorful and hilarious way to take part without fighting the crowds .  	joy	blog
20021	13194_1	 how good the World Cup was for Berlin as a city , and Germany as a nation  	joy	blog
20030	13194_2	 And let me tell you 	joy	blog
20039	13195_1	 that emerged during the Cup  	noemotion	blog
20049	13195_2	 Another interesting element was the latent patriotism 	joy	blog
20058	13196_1	 before the World Cup began , if you waved a German flag in the streets  	noemotion	blog
20067	13196_2	 Now this merits explaining : 	noemotion	blog
20077	13196_3	 , you would probably be called a Nazi and at the very least labeled as a radical right wing nutter .  	disgust	blog
20085	13197_1	 that the Germans have had a really difficult time with their national identity and subsequently national pride or patriotism of any kind since the Second World War  	sadness	blog
20094	13197_2	 You have to understand 	noemotion	blog
20102	13198_1	 And for what it 's worth I agree with them  	fear	blog
20117	13198_3	 , it makes me nervous too .  	fear	blog
22362	13199_1	  People were genuinely excited about supporting their national team , 	joy	blog
22363	13199_2	  and taking pride in its accomplishments . 	joy	blog
25907	1319_2	 Yakusho and Shimizu ... create engaging characterizations in Imamura 's lively 	joy	moviereview

6943	131_3	 while deconstructing the very format of the biography in a manner that Derrida would doubtless give his blessing to 	joy	moviereview
3349	13200_1	Now this newfound enthusiasm certainly was not shared by everyone.	disgust	blog
22364	13201_1	  In fact the entire month of June was one continuous debate in the media between prominent politicians , celebrities , writers such as Guenther Grass  and Christa Wolf , 	noemotion	blog
22365	13201_3	  and other intellectuals about the meaning , origin 	noemotion	blog
22366	13201_4	  and impact of this nationalism . 	noemotion	blog
5165	13202_1	And of course no one can laboriously dissect an idea better than the Germans.	joy	blog
20127	13203_1	 that the newfound national pride was a positive thing  	joy	blog
20137	13203_2	 But the general consensus after five weeks of debate was 	joy	blog
20146	13204_1	 which I started at the end of the month  	noemotion	blog

20173	13205_2	 This camp , about 40 miles north of Berlin was the second major camp to be opened in the Nazi system , and was also used by the Russians 	noemotion	blog
20182	13206_1	 that information , and trying to put it into some kind of historical context  	anticipation	blog
20192	13206_2	 Given the dark history of such a place you can well imagine the difficulty of retelling 	disgust	blog
22367	13207_1	  After a July of beautiful weather 	joy	blog

25909	1321_1	  Ruzowitzky has taken this mothball-y stuff 	disgust	moviereview

20138	13395_2	 that our emotions are always connected to a need being met or unmet  	anticipation	blog
20156	13395_4	 we must first realize 	noemotion	blog
20165	13396_1	 why we are feeling a particular emotion  	other	blog
20174	13396_2	 that has been satisfied  	joy	blog
20183	13396_3	 By listening to our emotions and asking ourselves 	joy	blog
20193	13396_4	 we can discover an unmet need or a need 	anticipation	blog
20202	13397_1	 For instance , if I feel sad because I have not seen my family in a long time  	sadness	blog
20221	13397_3	 my need for connection has not been met .  	sadness	blog
20231	13398_1	 if I feel happy because I have spent time with my family then  	joy	blog

20297	13400_2	 and a society  that is by the most part feelings illiterate  	disgust	blog
20305	13400_3	 We live in a society 	noemotion	blog
20322	13401_1	 what we are feeling  	noemotion	blog
20331	13401_2	 Well , for starters become aware of 	noemotion	blog
20341	13402_1	 we can then go on to vocalize it  	noemotion	blog
20347	13402_2	 Once we put our finger on the emotion  	noemotion	blog
20357	13402_3	 we are feeling 	joy	blog
20366	13403_1	 that incorporates identifying our feelings  	noemotion	blog

20385	13403_3	 and needs into the model .  	noemotion	blog
20395	13404_1	 because I am needing  	noemotion	blog

22444	13406_1	  The heart is about 3 feet long 	noemotion	blog
22445	13406_2	  and 3 inches thick all around . 	noemotion	blog
20413	13407_1	 that Nonviolent communication , which focuses on feelings and needs is the language of the heart because it focuses on what is alive in the heart  	joy	blog
20421	13407_2	 The idea is 	joy	blog
22446	13408_1	  By stating our feelings 	noemotion	blog
22447	13408_2	  and needs to others we avoid blaming 	noemotion	blog
22448	13408_3	  and criticizing them . 	disgust	blog
5187	13409_1	We can then go on to making a request instead of a demand to help ourselves satisfy our now recognized need.	noemotion	blog
8010	1340_1	 Remember the kind of movie 	noemotion	moviereview
8011	1340_2	 we were hoping `` Ecks vs. Sever '' or `` xXx '' was going to be ? 	anticipation	moviereview

22449	13413_1	  By satisfying our needs 	joy	blog
22450	13413_2	  and the needs of others we can reach a fair negotiation . 	noemotion	blog
22451	13414_1	  We can make a list of these feelings 	noemotion	blog
22452	13414_2	  and be on the look out for them . 	noemotion	blog
20503	13415_1	 that we need to take a timeout when we feel these feelings to avoid a conflict  	noemotion	blog
20512	13415_2	 It may be 	noemotion	blog
20521	13416_1	 For instance , if we feel furious  	anger	blog
20538	13416_3	 it may be better to take a one hour timeout and calm down .  	anger	blog

18806	13449_1	 that even has socialists and revolutionaries saying ` hey , hold on a second  	noemotion	blog
18813	13449_2	 It 's yet another white man insensitivity subject 	disgust	blog
25921	1344_1	  The film 's almost unbearable portrait of sadness 	sadness	moviereview

22460	13451_1	  I 'm not going to get into the wrongs 	noemotion	blog
22461	13451_2	  and rights , just to give a bit of perspective . 	noemotion	blog
22462	13452_1	  I see the words veil 	noemotion	blog
22463	13452_2	  and headscarf being used by white Europeans in many contradictory contexts . 	noemotion	blog
18830	13453_1	 that covers the hair and usually wraps around the neck  	noemotion	blog
18839	13453_2	 Hijab is a headscarf 	noemotion	blog
18848	13454_1	 where womens heads are completely covered so as to see only the eyes , or in some cases nothing at all  	noemotion	blog
18858	13454_2	 The veil is often interpreted as being the ninja outfit , 	noemotion	blog
5189	13455_1	For clarification the difference should be noted.	noemotion	blog
18867	13456_1	 that women should practice modesty both for themselves  	noemotion	blog

18894	13457_1	 The veil that covers the entire face  	noemotion	blog
18913	13457_3	 is called the nikab .  	noemotion	blog

18931	13460_2	 just like the west has some Christian right wackies  	disgust	blog
18939	13460_3	 A Fatwa , or Islamic legal pronouncement makes it clear 	noemotion	blog
18948	13460_4	 - but rather this is a cultural issue within more conservative or radical interpretations of Islam 	noemotion	blog
24163	13461_1	  It most certainly raised even more anti-Muslim sentiment 	disgust	blog
24164	13461_2	  but also more anti-French sentiment even amongst it own non-Christian communities . 	disgust	blog

19097	13473_2	 It is also true 	noemotion	blog
5196	13474_1	France says no head scarves, no nothing -- look like a sexy french school girl with your belly button hanging out.	joy	blog

20369	13947_1	 I do n't bother with it  	disgust	blog

24193	13950_1	  we have no one to blame 	disgust	blog
24194	13950_2	  but our selves . 	noemotion	blog
2703	13951_1	society has become just one big stress pool.	disgust	blog
20406	13952_1	 Our conversations with family , friends , co-workers etc. 	noemotion	blog
20415	13952_2	 all seem to revolve around how crappy are day is , has been , or is going to be  	disgust	blog
20424	13952_3	 and it seems all like we compete with one another to see who has a crappier one  	disgust	blog
20459	13953_1	 where I am going with this  	noemotion	blog
20467	13953_2	 I have no clue .  	noemotion	blog
20477	13954_1	 what I want in the long run  	noemotion	blog
20487	13954_2	 I do n't have a plan , I do n't know 	noemotion	blog
20496	13955_1	 who pushes me over the edge  	anger	blog
20506	13955_2	 I love my family unconditionally , and cherish every moment with them , even my eldest sister , 	joy	blog
20515	13955_3	 , but I have developed a certain method inwhich to deal with it .  	noemotion	blog
22593	13956_1	  I have to look at life in her perspective , 	noemotion	blog
22594	13956_2	  and it would break anyones heart . 	sadness	blog
20524	13957_1	 something foreign that has stolen away your chance of a normal life 	sadness	blog
20531	13957_2	 that you can not control  	disgust	blog
20541	13957_3	 To have something inside of you 	sadness	blog
1422	13958_1	being alienated, being alone.	sadness	blog
22595	13959_1	  I can only take so much of her though , for her sake 	disgust	blog

20560	13960_1	 where I have come to know some amazing people who have such potential , but possibly will never get to put it to any use due to the cirumstances of the choices in life  	joy	blog
20570	13960_2	 I have a job 	noemotion	blog
1154	13961_1	but they make my time at work memorable.	joy	blog
22597	13962_1	  I have put my life in the hands of god , 	trust	blog
22598	13962_2	  and left him to it . 	noemotion	blog
1155	13963_1	I am happy with a casual, not serious, no pressure relationship.	joy	blog
5261	13964_1	I frankly would be just as happy alone.	joy	blog
25262	13965_1	  Still there is so much more to learn , 	noemotion	blog
25263	13965_2	  and my life is 	noemotion	blog
25264	13965_3	  but young . 	noemotion	blog
20579	13966_1	 I want to do during my time  	noemotion	blog
20587	13966_2	 I have a list of things 	noemotion	blog
20596	13966_3	 , and each day I add something new to it .  	joy	blog
20606	13967_1	 I do n't run out of time to complete it  	noemotion	blog
20616	13967_2	 laughing out loud , lets just hope 	joy	blog
20626	13968_1	 while I was in church  	noemotion	blog
20635	13968_2	 anyway I heard this 	noemotion	blog
20645	13968_3	 and it really grabbed my interest .  	joy	blog
5262	13969_1	A few days ago, I ran into this article online: http://msnbc.msn.com/id/14126192/ talking about statistics regarding the number of friends people having being at some sort of new low.	noemotion	blog
8052	1396_1	 it needs to be  	joy	moviereview
8053	1396_2	 It is amusing , and that 's all 	joy	moviereview
20653	13970_1	 the article refers to  	noemotion	blog
20663	13970_2	 in regards to having only 2 or 3 friends that would fall into the support mechanism category , if only because of circumstantial or geographical factors being taken into consideration as well  	noemotion	blog
20670	13970_3	 I guess I fit the group 	disgust	blog
22599	13971_1	  One of those 3 will be moving this fall , 	noemotion	blog
22600	13971_2	  and the others have an awful lot going on in their lives , in addition to being less available than the first by a long shot anyhow . 	disgust	blog
20688	13972_1	 and the way I've maintained them as well  	noemotion	blog
20697	13972_2	 that I 've cultivated my friendships  	noemotion	blog
20706	13972_3	 On a larger scale , this really makes me think about the way 	joy	blog
20724	13973_1	 like , moreso than any other time in my life , I 'm operating almost at the ground floor in regards to the friendships I have and the way I interact with those friends  	sadness	blog
20733	13973_2	 I definitely feel 	noemotion	blog
20743	13974_1	 which have altered my ability to fully engage some people as well , be they circumstacial or environmental or whatever 	noemotion	blog
20753	13974_2	 which have hampered my ability to be trusted as much as I 'd like to be by some of my friends  	sadness	blog
20762	13974_3	 I 've burned a lot of bridges and engaged in decisions 	sadness	blog
20772	13974_4	 , and likewise , there have been things 	noemotion	blog
20790	13975_1	 that there are a fair amount of people out there whom I would count among my friends , but limited few whom I would count as good friends , due to actions both inside and outside of my role in that friendship  	joy	blog
20799	13975_2	 Suffice to say 	sadness	blog
22601	13976_1	  We 're getting older , we have a lot more work-related matters 	noemotion	blog
22602	13976_2	  and our personal lives can get pretty complicated . 	noemotion	blog
24195	13977_1	  You build friendships as fortifications against getting too old too fast , 	noemotion	blog
24196	13977_2	  but sometimes life just catches up with you regardless of your efforts . 	fear	blog
20808	13978_1	 that I still hold the same value system that I held when I was 18 years old  	noemotion	blog
20818	13978_2	 On a big picture scale , I 'd like to believe 	joy	blog
20828	13978_3	 , now a scary half-a-lifetime ago .  	fear	blog
20837	13979_1	 what keeps you going  	noemotion	blog
18512	13979_2	 All in all , I 'm satisfied with the bigger picture and angry as fuck at the smaller details , but that 's 	joy	blog
18520	13979_3	 , is n't it .  	anger	blog
201	1397_1	Among the year 's most intriguing explorations of alientation .	joy	moviereview
18530	13980_1	 I've seen what they do to people  	noemotion	blog
18540	13980_2	 As far as support mechanisms go  	noemotion	blog
18549	13980_3	 as a bridge to help people reach things both within and outside themself that they may not have been previously able to reach  	joy	blog
18566	13980_5	 - at their best , they act 	noemotion	blog
18574	13981_1	 where you hang your hat  	noemotion	blog
18581	13981_2	 you 'd even expect to look for it  	anticipation	blog
18591	13981_3	 Home may be 	disgust	blog
18601	13981_4	 , but happiness is sometimes found far from home or in the last place 	joy	blog
18610	13982_1	 I think sometimes it can be easy to lose track of the idea 	noemotion	blog
18620	13982_2	 that happiness and comfort are two completely separate entities 	sadness	blog
19645	13982_3	 and having one does not guarantee or equal having the other some of the time , at least 	disgust	blog
18630	13983_1	 that some people only mark success by arriving at a goal , while others are capable of enjoying the efforts required to reach that goal as well  	joy	blog
18636	13983_2	 It goes back to that whole journey vs. destination idea , in 	noemotion	blog
18645	13984_1	 if the goals are similar , which one would  	noemotion	blog
18653	13984_2	 you prefer to be .  	noemotion	blog
18663	13985_1	 which are productive and goal-oriented , whereas there are also friendships that meander along the way  	noemotion	blog
18673	13985_2	 Friendship works the same way - some people only appreciate friendships 	trust	blog
18682	13985_3	 , and each moment can be as interesting and rewarding as the ones before and after .  	joy	blog
18690	13986_1	 just what a friendship really means to you , especially when it 's something you can take for granted fairly easily if you are n't careful  	disgust	blog
18699	13986_2	 It can be really difficult to appreciate 	noemotion	blog
18707	13987_1	 I know I 'm guilty of that all the time  	sadness	blog
18723	13988_1	 what we 've lost until something becomes too distant and difficult to regain  	sadness	blog
18733	13988_2	 Often we fail to realize 	sadness	blog
18742	13989_1	 which then becomes amnesia  	disgust	blog
18752	13989_2	 that ca n't be healed  	sadness	blog
18759	13989_3	 if it ever happened  	sadness	blog
18765	13989_4	 Old wounds fester into something 	disgust	blog
18773	13989_5	 , neglect becomes forgetfulness 	disgust	blog
18780	13989_6	 , and before long you wonder 	disgust	blog
202	1398_1	A full world has been presented onscreen , not some series of carefully structured plot points building to a pat resolution .	joy	moviereview
25265	13990_1	  It sucks , 	disgust	blog
25266	13990_2	  and it takes effort to keep a swerving friendship from heading down these sort of paths , 	disgust	blog
25267	13990_3	  but the effort far outweighs the consequences of failing to do so . 	disgust	blog
18790	13991_1	 It means I have some tough choices to make  	noemotion	blog
18809	13992_1	 so  whatever efforts I expend have to be met with some sort of equal efforts or the process  	anger	blog
18815	13992_2	 I can only change my own mind 	anger	blog
18823	13992_3	 goes nowhere and frustrates me the entire way .  	disgust	blog
18833	13993_1	 play out its  	joy	blog
18841	13993_2	 Is it worth it , or is it better to just let fate 	noemotion	blog
18851	13993_3	 ' hand and look for a new deal .  	anticipation	blog
18860	13994_1	 until it 's too late regardless  	noemotion	blog
18870	13994_2	 There 's usually no way to know 	noemotion	blog
18879	13995_1	 I guess I do what I can to make the most of what I have , if it 's not enough then it likely never was 	joy	blog
19654	13995_2	 and in that case , at least I know I tried  	joy	blog
18897	13996_1	 If being a friend is n't about trying  	noemotion	blog
18906	13996_2	 , then I 've been taking the wrong approach all along .  	disgust	blog
18916	13997_1	 As of late , it seems that everything my parents do  	noemotion	blog
18924	13997_2	 , they do it just to annoy me . They 're great parents .  	joy	blog
8502	13998_1	I'm not going to go into specifics here, but it almost always ends up in yelling and tears.	anger	blog
18934	13999_1	 why the hell everything turns out this way  	anger	blog
18942	13999_2	 I was thinking about our most recent spat today at dinner and wondering 	disgust	blog
203	1399_1	Seldom has a movie so closely matched the spirit of a man and his work .	joy	moviereview
25383	139_1	  Run , do n't walk , to see this barbed 	joy	moviereview

18950	14000_1	 that I want out  	noemotion	blog
18960	14000_2	 My only plausible explanation is 	disgust	blog
18970	14001_1	 how much I love them  	anticipation	blog
18980	14001_2	 No matter 	joy	blog
18987	14001_3	 , I want to be independent and living on my own , providing for myself and on the road to success .  	anticipation	blog
18996	14002_1	 that I will reach this place soon enough  	disgust	blog
19006	14002_2	 like it is taking forever  	anger	blog
19015	14002_3	 Now , I know 	anger	blog
19024	14002_4	 , but damn it feels 	anger	blog
19034	14003_1	 who 's in college to be living with their parents  	noemotion	blog
19044	14003_2	 but that does n't quell the wish to be independent and free  	anticipation	blog
19053	14003_3	 I know its normal for someone 	noemotion	blog

19099	14009_2	 further when he said My new food is making me feel really healthy  	noemotion	blog
19108	14009_3	 Further to that by the way , I did speak to him about it 	noemotion	blog

19277	14017_1	 if his definition of more important things than actually looking after yourself like an adult is n't important enough  	disgust	blog
19286	14017_2	 no wonder he does n't have a girlfrend 	disgust	blog
19296	14018_1	 what pisses me most off about the food delivery issue  	anger	blog
19306	14018_2	 is that he has chosen the easy  	anger	blog
19313	14018_3	 I think though , 	anger	blog

19389	14020_4	 , it 's just really irritating me , 	disgust	blog
19400	14020_5	 - he just is lazy .  	anger	blog
2704	14021_1	He could EASILY cook his own food - his kitchen probably cost more than half my house.	anger	blog

22614	14041_1	  I walked over to the heater as the first port of call 	noemotion	blog
22615	14041_2	  and was very surprised when ` oh ! ' it would n't turn on . 	surprise	blog
19609	14042_1	 that maybe it had broken the night before , after I 'd gone to bed or something  	noemotion	blog

22616	14043_1	  Trying to turn it back on only got me another automatic trip as lights flashed on for a brief moment , 	noemotion	blog
22617	14043_2	  and then suddenly back off . 	noemotion	blog
19630	14044_1	 until the safety was tripped  	anger	blog
19640	14044_2	 Grrrr - I then spent the next 10 minutes or so turning everything off in the house , switching the safety switch back on , and then sequentially turning everything back on 	anger	blog
19649	14045_1	 what to do , not really  	anticipation	blog

19670	14045_3	 being able to afford either a new fridge OR to fix this one .  	noemotion	blog
19680	14046_1	 but that idea was sadly left behind due to monetary issues  	sadness	blog
19691	14046_2	 about possibly buying a new fridge for themselves  	sadness	blog
19702	14046_3	 At first one of my housemates thought 	sadness	blog

19774	14052_1	 As we wrote in a recent posting , even in a favorable political climate  	sadness	blog
19784	14052_2	 Democratic candidates face a significant challenge in turning out their base voters .  	noemotion	blog
22618	14053_1	  Despite widespread dissatisfaction among Democrats with the Bush administration 	disgust	blog
22619	14053_2	  and overall Republican governance , we detect no real signs so far at least in Harris County of a groundswell to actually vote in November . 	noemotion	blog
19793	14054_1	 that this year Republicans too will have a difficult time turning out their party faithful on November 7th  	disgust	blog
19801	14054_2	 An oft-repeated notion in recent weeks , however , has been 	noemotion	blog
19811	14055_1	 that anger nationally over rising gas prices and health care costs , a protracted , expensive war with no conclusion in sight , and a perception among religious conservatives that George W. Bush has failed to deliver on the social issues that motivate them has taken a toll with GOP base voters  	anger	blog
19819	14055_2	 The argument goes 	noemotion	blog
19827	14056_1	 As noted in the latest issue of US News World Report  	noemotion	blog
19836	14056_2	 that they will vote to return their party 's elected officials to power  	trust	blog
19845	14056_3	 , new polling has Republican insiders feeling pretty darn good about turning out their folks this fall , with confidence 	joy	blog
19854	14057_1	 which highlights polling granted , six-week old polling showing the base is in line and ready to hit the polls  	noemotion	blog
19864	14057_2	 The article cites a recent strategic memo to national GOP Party Chair Ken Mehlman from Market Strategies , 	noemotion	blog
19873	14058_1	 that assumes weak Republican turnout as a key to winning is folly 	disgust	blog
19881	14058_2	 Obviously no way to tell at this point , but any Democratic victory strategy 	disgust	blog
19898	14059_1	 all the other guy 's usual folks will vote  	anticipation	blog
19908	14059_2	 In other words , the mantra for Democratic candidates this political season : persuade everyone you can  	noemotion	blog
19925	14059_4	 , turn out your base , and assume 	noemotion	blog
204	1405_1	It 's made with deftly unsettling genre flair .	joy	moviereview

5346	14650_1	It wasn't because I was sad though.	noemotion	blog
20354	14651_1	 Hey , I feel like I 'm going to pass out  	anticipation	blog
20363	14651_2	 I looked over at Jon and I said 	noemotion	blog
20373	14652_1	 my head slammed into the window behind me and I fell on the floor  	noemotion	blog
20382	14652_2	 Then I guess 	noemotion	blog
25293	14653_1	  I woke up to Jon picking up my head 	noemotion	blog
25294	14653_2	  and saying my name , 	noemotion	blog
25295	14653_3	  but I could n't hear him . 	noemotion	blog
20392	14654_1	 because I have a kidney infection that was making me dehydrated and nauseous  	disgust	blog
20400	14654_2	 It 's because of thing called vasovagal syncope and was triggered 	noemotion	blog
20410	14655_1	 I hope I can at least pass out sometime when it 's sweet  	joy	blog
20418	14655_2	 like when I 'm driving or operating heavy machinery 	noemotion	blog
20428	14656_1	 I know I have not been writing 4 a long time  	noemotion	blog
22791	14657_1	  I will never try one again 	disgust	blog
22792	14657_2	  and i suggest you do the same . 	disgust	blog
20445	14658_1	 It started raining jus B4 it started  	noemotion	blog
24231	14659_1	  I did not climb very high up 	joy	blog
24232	14659_2	  but was not bad either . 	joy	blog
25974	1465_1	  Challenging , intermittently engrossing 	joy	moviereview
25975	1465_2	  and unflaggingly creative . 	joy	moviereview
20463	14660_1	 like I always do at home to watch the national parade  	noemotion	blog
20471	14660_2	 I spent my national day 	noemotion	blog
22793	14661_1	  My school choir was taking part 	noemotion	blog
22794	14661_2	  and i saw them too . 	noemotion	blog
20481	14662_1	 I guess it 's a lot more involved than I had thought  	noemotion	blog
20500	14663_1	 Anyway , as the day proceeded it seemed to be getting easier , and I was so sure  	joy	blog
20519	14663_3	 I had the basics down pat .  	noemotion	blog
20527	14664_1	 until it was time to count my drawer  	noemotion	blog
20535	14664_2	 I felt this way up 	noemotion	blog
20545	14665_1	 that it was giving up time  	sadness	blog
20554	14665_2	 After that I had pretty much decided 	noemotion	blog
20564	14666_1	 I guess that made me feel a little bit more at ease  	joy	blog
20583	14667_1	 OF course I was stressing it too much because as the day proceeded  	noemotion	blog
20591	14667_2	 , I began to feel myself becoming more and more comfortable with everything .  	joy	blog
22795	14668_1	  The end of the day came 	noemotion	blog
22796	14668_2	  and it was than time to count out my drawer . 	noemotion	blog
20600	14669_1	 what a relief  	joy	blog
20610	14669_2	 that was for me laughing out loud  	joy	blog
20620	14669_3	 My change was exact down to the last penny , 	noemotion	blog
8306	1466_1	But it 's too long and too convoluted and it ends in a muddle .	disgust	moviereview
1177	14670_1	Today day three went relatively smoothe.	joy	blog
20639	14671_1	 since I got to hang out with Lauren the night before : -RSB- To make this somewhat shorter  	joy	blog
20649	14671_2	 But it was was n't so bad 	joy	blog
24233	14672_1	  My charges were .50 short , 	noemotion	blog
24234	14672_2	  but apparently that 's not a horrible thing . 	joy	blog
22797	14673_1	  Tomorrow I have to go in at 8 	noemotion	blog
22798	14673_2	  and stay till 5pm . 	noemotion	blog
20657	14674_1	 than for this coming week they have me down for nearly everyday till closing time  	anticipation	blog
20666	14674_2	 Urrr two more hours > . Ahh 	disgust	blog
1305	14675_1	Hopefully tomorrow will go smoothe.	anticipation	blog
22799	14676_1	  Another little check-off on the to-do list , as all three of my summer classes are now done 	joy	blog
22800	14676_2	  and graded , 	noemotion	blog
22801	14676_3	  and I still retain my 4.0 GPA . 	noemotion	blog
20674	14677_1	 I identified  when I first got back into school  	joy	blog
20682	14677_2	 than most since I 'm now past the second of the three major problem classes  	joy	blog
20692	14677_3	 It 's a bit more satisfying this time 	joy	blog
20710	14678_1	 otherwise that I ought to be able to excel at the highest level at most things  	anticipation	blog
20718	14678_2	 I assume until proven 	trust	blog
20727	14678_3	 , so a top grade in all of my classes was always the goal from day 1 .  	anticipation	blog
20737	14679_1	 I know full well I 've been between mediocre and bad at in the past - theoretical math , foreign languages , public speaking  	disgust	blog
20747	14679_2	 However , there are several things 	noemotion	blog
24423	1467_1	  The vivid lead performances sustain interest and empathy ,	joy	moviereview
24424	1467_3	  but the journey is far more interesting than the final destination . 	joy	moviereview
20757	14680_1	 class I 've been in this summer were the three classes I 've assumed  	noemotion	blog
20766	14680_2	 Thus , Statistics , mandatory Spanish , and the public speaking 	noemotion	blog
20776	14680_3	 were most likely to potentially drop my GPA .  	noemotion	blog
20785	14681_1	 I got perhaps 4 questions wrong over 5 or 6 tests in all of stats and secured an A easily in Speech  	joy	blog
20794	14681_2	 So far that 's turned out to be little problem - I believe 	noemotion	blog
20802	14682_1	 themselves were coming to me much easier than they did  	joy	blog
20812	14682_2	 What 's more  	noemotion	blog
20822	14682_3	 , I could tell the subjects 	noemotion	blog
20832	14682_4	 , say , 5 years ago - so it was n't simply a matter of more lax evaluation .  	joy	blog
20841	14683_1	 that I seem to be improving in areas which were previously more difficult  	anticipation	blog
18515	14683_2	 None of this is really an achievement of course , but it is nice to know 	disgust	blog
18524	14684_1	 that leads to me trying to further develop my natural cross-handedness into ambidexterity  	disgust	blog
18534	14684_2	 I dislike the idea of having gaps in my ability ; it 's the same need for balance 	disgust	blog
18543	14685_1	 and  so I was best served by following and developing that side of my talents  	noemotion	blog
18553	14685_2	 that I excelled verbally at potentially the highest level  	joy	blog
18561	14685_3	 I 've always been aware 	noemotion	blog
18577	14685_5	 ; but I refuse to allow that pursuit and development to leave me lopsided or with deficiencies in other areas .  	anticipation	blog
22802	14686_1	  I have a month off of classes now , to do research 	noemotion	blog
22803	14686_2	  and move 	noemotion	blog
22804	14686_3	  and probably take up an internship job . 	anticipation	blog
3432	14687_1	I'm going to have to go out to south London area police station sometime tomorrow.	noemotion	blog
18585	14688_1	 that I think the Tube will have to do do for transport  	noemotion	blog
18595	14688_2	 The weather is looking so pleasant 	joy	blog
24235	14689_1	  A little unfortunate , 	disgust	blog
24236	14689_2	  but at least it saves me from actually walking there . 	joy	blog
211	1468_1	A painfully funny ode to bad behavior .	joy	moviereview
18605	14690_1	 who 's going to watch the shop while I 'm gone  	noemotion	blog
18614	14690_2	 If it had n't been so important  	noemotion	blog
18624	14690_3	 I 'd have refused their invitation anyway - 	disgust	blog
18632	14691_1	 what could happen if  	anticipation	blog
18640	14691_2	 While I 've got every faith in my employees abilities  	trust	blog
18648	14691_3	 , I would n't like to think about 	fear	blog
18657	14692_1	 it was a wonder  he did n't pass out  	disgust	blog
18667	14692_2	 that came around off with such a red face  	surprise	blog
18677	14692_3	 I sent the last one 	noemotion	blog
18694	14693_1	 that I 'm old enough to learn lessons on my own and not from others , either by teaching or example , because people are stupid  	anger	blog
18702	14693_2	 It 's good 	joy	blog
18711	14694_1	 that most people have no concept of what turn signals , speed limits , and restroom sinks are for  	anger	blog
18719	14694_2	 Seven hours on the road in two days , and I 've come to the conclusion 	disgust	blog
18727	14695_1	 to use the bathroom on the turnpike 	noemotion	blog
18737	14695_2	 and had to wait  because it was so busy  	disgust	blog
18746	14695_3	 I stopped in New Gloucester 	noemotion	blog
18762	14696_1	 after another take a piss then leave without washing his hands  	disgust	blog
18768	14696_2	 I saw one guy 	disgust	blog
22805	14697_1	  Finally it was my turn , I use the facilities , go to the sink , find myself the only one there , 	noemotion	blog
22806	14697_2	  and a constant line of guys behind me just filing out , again without using the sink . 	disgust	blog
5347	14698_1	There wasn't even a cursory, pretend wash amounting to little more than a cold water rinse.	disgust	blog
22807	14699_1	  I finally snapped 	anger	blog
22808	14699_2	  and yelled out the door at the last two DOES ANYONE WASH THEIR FRIGGING HANDS AFTER USING THE BATHROOM ANYMORE . 	anger	blog
212	1469_1	` Easily my choice for one of the year 's best films . '	joy	moviereview
25387	146_1	  -LRB- Schweiger is -RRB- talented 	joy	moviereview

18776	14700_1	 where a number of them had congregated for a late lunch  	noemotion	blog
18784	14700_2	 Disgusted , I dried my hands , walked out , and yelled PIGS ! toward the Burger King 	disgust	blog
18794	14701_1	 where their hands have been prior to touching the same surfaces that I have , such as the toilet seat , flush lever  	disgust	blog
18803	14701_2	 While I have no doubt whatsoever that my equipment is clean and disease free I devote at least as much attention to cleaning that as I do my hands ; any women dating these boys should be weary of the possible filth that probably accompanies sexual relations with him if he ca n't even take care of his hands  	disgust	blog
18811	14701_3	 , I can not say the same for others , and can not vouch for 	disgust	blog
18819	14701_4	 , and door handles .  	noemotion	blog
18827	14702_1	 where their cold sores came from : Daddy did n't wash his hands in the restroom , then he  	disgust	blog
18836	14702_2	 Hey assholes , explain to your children 	anger	blog
18845	14702_3	 cleaned the ketchup off your face , and now you have herpes .  	disgust	blog
18855	14703_1	 while it 's unlikely that you 'll catch something major from a dirty turnpike restroom  	fear	blog
18864	14703_2	 Old guy , 	noemotion	blog
18873	14703_3	 , even a case of the flu could kill at your age .  	noemotion	blog
2715	14704_1	UNCLEAN! should at the very least be a public restroom on the interstate.	disgust	blog
22809	14705_1	  Simply entering one should make you feel dirty 	disgust	blog
22810	14705_2	  and in want of a shower . 	noemotion	blog
3433	14706_1	We saw Descent at the local 'ghetto' theater, in the local 'ghetto' mall.	disgust	blog
18883	14707_1	 like the Airport Mall here in Bangor : the automatic doors , for instance , are n't necessarily automatic anymore  	noemotion	blog
18891	14707_2	 You know , it 's 	noemotion	blog
18901	14708_1	 that much more , the former Hoyt 's and even the cheap seats at Spotlight in Orono all have the new stadium seats , bigger screens , and latest sound tech  	joy	blog
18910	14708_2	 It makes me appreciate the local cinemas 	joy	blog
8510	14709_1	But it was nice to get out to the movies with Holly, I don't get to see her very much at all in any role other than as mom, and as a single male with no kids, it's hard to associate myself with parents.	joy	blog
213	1470_1	Charles ' entertaining film chronicles Seinfeld 's return to stand-up comedy after the wrap of his legendary sitcom , alongside wannabe comic Adams ' attempts to get his shot at the big time .	joy	moviereview
22811	14710_1	  Ask any comedian , they usually have a bit about the inability of the childless to relate to parents 	noemotion	blog
22812	14710_2	  and vice versa . 	noemotion	blog
18918	14711_1	 Not that Erin has a problem  	noemotion	blog
18928	14711_2	 , she loves kids and works with them , but I 've never honestly been much of a kid person .  	noemotion	blog
24237	14712_1	  Older kids , sure , I can identify with short , immature 	disgust	blog
24238	14712_2	  but otherwise rational human beings , 	disgust	blog
24239	14712_3	  but little kids . 	noemotion	blog
18937	14713_1	 when someone three feet tall smacks me in the head  	anger	blog
18946	14713_2	 What do I do 	noemotion	blog
25296	14714_1	  You ca n't beat them , you ca n't yell 	noemotion	blog
25297	14714_2	  and foam at the mouth , 	other	blog
25298	14714_3	  but you ca n't ignore it either . 	disgust	blog
18954	14715_1	 that you ca n't just go around pissing people off  	joy	blog
18964	14715_2	 But unlike that said territory , children grow-up at some point , and most at least realize 	noemotion	blog
18974	14716_1	 Though they undoubtedly do  	noemotion	blog
18991	14717_1	 that you might otherwise associate with a Hollywood movie that stars an entire cast of nothing but athletic women  	disgust	blog
19000	14717_2	 The plot was just full of loopholes , there was n't even any gratuitous boobage 	disgust	blog
19010	14718_1	 oh I 'm cute  	disgust	blog
19019	14718_2	 No , these were n't the 	disgust	blog
19028	14718_3	 , see my ta-tas ? kind of athleticly built women , these were the see me hang from the roof of a cave by my fingernails type , the I do n't even need a sportsbra kind of actual athletes .  	disgust	blog
19038	14719_1	 that you could drive a truck through  	noemotion	blog
19047	14719_2	 But this one was just full of plot holes 	disgust	blog
25976	1471_1	  That dogged good will of the parents 	joy	moviereview
25977	1471_2	  and ` vain ' Jia 's defoliation of ego , make the film touching despite some doldrums . 	joy	moviereview
19057	14720_1	 IF you actually want to see The Descent then  	disgust	blog
19066	14720_2	 stop here and go do your nails or something .  	disgust	blog
5348	14721_1	Ok, so at one point they find a dead moose in the middle of the cave system.	noemotion	blog
22813	14722_1	  Oh they kill the food outside 	noemotion	blog
22814	14722_2	  and bring it inside to eat . 	noemotion	blog
3434	14723_1	And what about the primitive cave paintings by the local natives thousands of years ago.	noemotion	blog
22815	14724_1	  I do n't find the idea of poking around in the dark deep in the bowels of the earth very entertaining at all , I do n't think our ancestors , devoid of electric flashlights 	disgust	blog
22816	14724_2	  and safety equipment would be any more inclined to risking their life for so worthless an enterprise . 	disgust	blog
3435	14725_1	Is there food that deep in the cave.	noemotion	blog
19076	14726_1	 that prayed upon human beings so very long ago  	noemotion	blog
19085	14726_2	 before we took to cave drawing  	disgust	blog
19094	14726_3	 If this took place in the wilds of Africa  	disgust	blog
19103	14726_4	 , perhaps it might be worth venturing into the earth to escape the large predators 	noemotion	blog
19112	14726_5	 , but even that was well 	noemotion	blog
19122	14727_1	 as to all the different ways it was just simply retarded  	disgust	blog
19132	14727_2	 After the movie and the subsequent discussion 	disgust	blog
19140	14727_3	 , we came back to the house and watched TiVo .  	noemotion	blog
22817	14728_1	  Holly 's gotten really into Dog the Bounty Hunter 	noemotion	blog
22818	14728_2	  and we watched an episode of that . 	noemotion	blog
19150	14729_1	 that I enjoy it if there 's really nothing else to watch  	joy	blog

19190	14731_2	 I 'm already convinced 	noemotion	blog

24240	14732_1	  Major Victory is entertaining , 	joy	blog

22819	14733_1	  Black suits for Spiderman 	noemotion	blog

19207	14734_1	 Reeves was a fatman in tights with no issues  	disgust	blog
19217	14734_2	 Look at Superman : the original television 	disgust	blog

5349	14736_1	We watch tube for a few hours, I watch Holly fold clothes, I head to bed in the basement then get up the next morning to watch Spiderman 2 with her and the kids.	noemotion	blog
22821	14737_1	  The turnpike was nuts , every asshole from Jersey 	disgust	blog
22822	14737_2	  and Connecticut was apparently heading to Canada . 	disgust	blog

19264	14739_1	 of which I experienced the last time  	noemotion	blog

19290	14741_1	 since Route One was pretty packed  	noemotion	blog
19300	14741_2	 Come Scarborough , I jumped back on , 	noemotion	blog
19308	14741_3	 , and I did n't want to go through downtown Portland .  	noemotion	blog
19317	14742_1	 after the traffic jam cleared , and ended up getting home 4 hours later than expected and having just enough time to get ready for work before heading out again  	noemotion	blog
19326	14742_2	 I abandoned the turnpike last time as well , shortly 	noemotion	blog
19335	14743_1	 where they should have been  	noemotion	blog
19344	14743_2	 So back on the pike , putting up with traffic , speeds picked up to well above 	noemotion	blog
19354	14743_3	 , things cleared a little north of Lewiston , a little more above Augusta , but it was still pretty frigging busy all the way up .  	anger	blog
