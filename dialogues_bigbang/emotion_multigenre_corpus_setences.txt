6362	As if Drop Dead Gorgeous was n't enough , this equally derisive clunker is fixated on the spectacle of small-town competition .	disgust	moviereview
6363	A wretched movie that reduces the Second World War to one man 's quest to find an old flame .	disgust	moviereview
6364	This is a remake by the numbers , linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which Wilson and Murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie .	disgust	moviereview

6400	The film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based ` drama , ' but the emphasis on the latter leaves Blue Crush waterlogged .	disgust	moviereview
6401	The problem is the needlessly poor quality of its archival prints and film footage .	disgust	moviereview

7330	Buries an interesting storyline about morality and the choices we make underneath such a mountain of clichs and borrowed images that it might more accurately be titled Mr. Chips off the Old Block .	disgust	moviereview

7346	Christina Ricci comedy about sympathy , hypocrisy and love is a misfire .	disgust	moviereview

7368	Very special effects , brilliantly bold colors and heightened reality ca n't hide the giant Achilles ' heel in `` Stuart Little 2 `` : There 's just no story , folks .	disgust	moviereview

7380	When the film ended , I felt tired and drained and wanted to lie on my own deathbed for a while .	disgust	moviereview
7381	Full of witless jokes , dealing in broad stereotypes and outrageously unbelievable scenarios , and saddled with a general air of misogyny	disgust	moviereview
7382	The film 's hackneyed message is not helped by the thin characterizations , nonexistent plot and pretentious visual style .	disgust	moviereview
7383	The Iditarod lasts for days - this just felt like it did .	disgust	moviereview
7384	It feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes .	disgust	moviereview
7385	This movie is maddening .	disgust	moviereview
7386	It conveys a simple message in a visual style that is willfully overwrought .	disgust	moviereview

7399	Though Moonlight Mile is replete with acclaimed actors and actresses and tackles a subject that 's potentially moving , the movie is too predictable and too self-conscious to reach a level of high drama .	disgust	moviereview
7400	A movie that hovers somewhere between an acute character study and a trite power struggle .	disgust	moviereview
7401	Corpus Collosum -- while undeniably interesting -- wore out its welcome well before the end credits rolled about 45 minutes in .	disgust	moviereview
7402	The last 20 minutes are somewhat redeeming , but most of the movie is the same teenage American road-trip drek we 've seen before - only this time you have to read the fart jokes	disgust	moviereview
7403	It 's hard to like a film about a guy who is utterly unlikeable , and Shiner , starring Michael Caine as an aging British boxing promoter desperate for a taste of fame and fortune , is certainly that .	disgust	moviereview
7404	A by-the-numbers effort that wo n't do much to enhance the franchise .	disgust	moviereview
7405	Involves two mysteries -- one it gives away and the other featuring such badly drawn characters that its outcome hardly matters .	disgust	moviereview
7406	Overall the film feels like a low-budget TV pilot that could not find a buyer to play it on the tube .	disgust	moviereview
7407	It 's of the quality of a lesser Harrison Ford movie - Six Days , Seven Nights , maybe , or that dreadful Sabrina remake .	disgust	moviereview
7408	It appears that something has been lost in the translation to the screen .	disgust	moviereview
7409	Despite all evidence to the contrary , this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie , the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on TV and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults .	disgust	moviereview
7410	An unclassifiably awful study in self - and audience-abuse .	disgust	moviereview
7411	This movie is something of an impostor itself , stretching and padding its material in a blur of dead ends and distracting camera work .	disgust	moviereview
7412	Hey Arnold !	noemotion	moviereview
7413	The Movie could have been made 40 years ago , and parents ' appreciation of it may depend on whether they consider that a good thing .	noemotion	moviereview
7414	This one is definitely one to skip , even for horror movie fanatics .	disgust	moviereview
7415	Excessive , profane , packed with cartoonish violence and comic-strip characters .	disgust	moviereview
7416	Once the 50 year old Benigni appears as the title character , we find ourselves longing for the block of wood to come back .	disgust	moviereview
7417	A working class `` us vs. them '' opera that leaves no heartstring untugged and no liberal cause unplundered .	joy	moviereview
7418	If the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of ` there but for the grace of God , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world .	disgust	moviereview
7419	There are simply too many ideas floating around -- part farce , part Sliding Doors , part pop video -- and yet failing to exploit them .	disgust	moviereview
7420	It takes a strange kind of laziness to waste the talents of Robert Forster , Anne Meara , Eugene Levy , and Reginald VelJohnson all in the same movie .	disgust	moviereview
7421	We have n't seen such hilarity since Say It Is n't So !	joy	moviereview
7422	Expect the same-old , lame-old slasher nonsense , just with different scenery .	disgust	moviereview
7423	The Cold Turkey would 've been a far better title .	disgust	moviereview
7424	The idea of 49-year-old Roberto Benigni playing the wooden boy Pinocchio is scary enough .	disgust	moviereview
7425	The reality of the new live-action Pinocchio he directed , cowrote and starred in borders on the grotesque .	disgust	moviereview
7426	The ga-zillionth airhead movie about a wife in distress who resorts to desperate measures .	disgust	moviereview
7427	Zaidan 's script has barely enough plot to string the stunts together and not quite enough characterization to keep the faces straight .	disgust	moviereview

7430	While it 's nice to watch a movie that has n't been focus-grouped into tedium , Yu 's cinematic alchemy produces nearly as much lead as gold .	disgust	moviereview
7431	It treats women like idiots .	disgust	moviereview
7432	Though Catch Me If You Can is n't badly made , the fun slowly leaks out of the movie .	disgust	moviereview
7433	Just an average comedic dateflick but not a waste of time .	joy	moviereview
7434	A valueless kiddie paean to pro basketball underwritten by the NBA .	disgust	moviereview
7435	Impostor has a handful of thrilling moments and a couple of good performances , but the movie does n't quite fly .	disgust	moviereview
7436	For starters , the story is just too slim .	disgust	moviereview
7437	So much facile technique , such cute ideas , so little movie .	disgust	moviereview
7438	The experience of going to a film festival is a rewarding one ; the experiencing of sampling one through this movie is not .	disgust	moviereview
7439	The film takes the materials of human tragedy and dresses them in lovely costumes , Southern California locations and star power .	joy	moviereview
7440	It has its moments of swaggering camaraderie , but more often just feels generic , derivative and done to death .	disgust	moviereview
7441	Almost gags on its own gore .	disgust	moviereview
7442	How do you spell clich ?	noemotion	moviereview
7443	It 's sweet , harmless , dumb , occasionally funny and about as compelling as a fishing show .	disgust	moviereview
7444	The moviegoing equivalent of going to a dinner party and being forced to watch the host and hostess 's home video of their baby 's birth .	disgust	moviereview
7445	While -LRB- Hill -RRB- has learned new tricks , the tricks alone are not enough to salvage this lifeless boxing film .	disgust	moviereview
7446	In the real world , an actor this uncharismatically beautiful would have a rsum loaded with credits like `` Girl in Bar # 3 . ''	disgust	moviereview
7447	Too much of it feels unfocused and underdeveloped .	disgust	moviereview

7451	Big Fat Waste of Time .	disgust	moviereview
7452	Hey Arnold !	noemotion	moviereview
7453	The Movie is what happens when you blow up small potatoes to 10 times their natural size , and it ai n't pretty .	disgust	moviereview
7454	Sometimes seems less like storytelling than something the otherwise compelling director needed to get off his chest .	disgust	moviereview
7455	This is not the undisputed worst boxing movie ever , but it 's certainly not a champion - the big loser is the audience .	disgust	moviereview
7456	You really have to wonder how on earth anyone , anywhere could have thought they 'd make audiences guffaw with a script as utterly diabolical as this .	disgust	moviereview
7457	In the end , we are left with something like two ships passing in the night rather than any insights into gay love , Chinese society or the price one pays for being dishonest .	disgust	moviereview
7458	Chokes on its own depiction of upper-crust decorum .	disgust	moviereview
7459	Well-nigh unendurable ... though the picture strains to become cinematic poetry , it remains depressingly prosaic and dull .	disgust	moviereview
7460	I thought my own watch had stopped keeping time as I slogged my way through Clockstoppers .	disgust	moviereview
7461	While much of the cast has charm -- especially Allodi and Nolden -- the performers are sunk by the film 's primitive approach to the mechanics of comedy .	disgust	moviereview
7462	This directorial debut from music video show-off Higuchinsky is all flash .	disgust	moviereview
7463	Yes , Ballistic is silly .	disgust	moviereview
7464	Unfortunately , it 's not silly fun unless you enjoy really bad movies .	disgust	moviereview
7465	The twist that ends the movie is the one with the most emotional resonance , but twists are getting irritating , and this is the kind of material where the filmmakers should be very careful about raising eyebrows .	disgust	moviereview
7466	The longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it 's actually pretty good in the first few minutes .	disgust	moviereview
7467	While it 's genuinely cool to hear characters talk about early rap records -LRB- Sugar Hill Gang , etc. -RRB- , the constant referencing of hip-hop arcana can alienate even the savviest audiences .	disgust	moviereview
7468	Not only unfunny , but downright repellent .	disgust	moviereview
7469	Care deftly captures the wonder and menace of growing up , but he never really embraces the joy of Fuhrman 's destructive escapism or the grace-in-rebellion found by his characters .	joy	moviereview
7470	Forced , familiar and thoroughly condescending .	disgust	moviereview
7471	Does little more than play an innocuous game of fill-in - the-blanks with a tragic past .	disgust	moviereview
7472	K-19 exploits our substantial collective fear of nuclear holocaust to generate cheap Hollywood tension .	disgust	moviereview
7473	Has a long and clunky ending ... which forces the audience to fidget through ten pseudo-serious minutes while waiting for the ending credits and the deleted scenes montage to break the audience 's awkward silence	disgust	moviereview
7474	A ragbag of promising ideas and failed narrative , of good acting and plain old bad filmmaking .	disgust	moviereview
7475	Whaley 's determination to immerse you in sheer , unrelenting wretchedness is exhausting .	disgust	moviereview
7476	Uncommonly stylish but equally silly ... the picture fails to generate much suspense , nor does it ask searching enough questions to justify its pretensions .	disgust	moviereview
7477	The entire movie is about a boring , sad man being boring and sad .	disgust	moviereview
7478	The plot convolutions ultimately add up to nothing more than jerking the audience 's chain .	disgust	moviereview
7479	Confirms the nagging suspicion that Ethan Hawke would be even worse behind the camera than he is in front of it .	disgust	moviereview
7480	Made with no discernible craft and monstrously sanctimonious in dealing with childhood loss .	disgust	moviereview
7481	It 's a trifle of a movie , with a few laughs surrounding an unremarkable soft center .	joy	moviereview
7482	Holden Caulfield did it better .	disgust	moviereview
7483	A synthesis of cliches and absurdities that seems positively decadent in its cinematic flash and emptiness .	disgust	moviereview
7484	Oh come on .	disgust	moviereview
7485	Like you could n't smell this turkey rotting from miles away .	disgust	moviereview
7486	If it 's seldom boring , well , it 's also rarely coherent .	disgust	moviereview
7487	Simplistic fluff-ball of whimsy .	disgust	moviereview
7488	Not exactly the Bees Knees	noemotion	moviereview
7489	It does nothing new with the old story , except to show fisticuffs in this sort of stop-go slow motion that makes the gang rumbles look like they 're being streamed over a 28K modem .	disgust	moviereview
7490	The kind of spectacularly misconceived enterprise that only a sophisticated cinephile could have perpetrated .	disgust	moviereview
7491	Makes for some truly odd , at times confusing , kids entertainment ... but at least this time there 's some centered storytelling to go along with all the weird stuff .	joy	moviereview
7492	The film contains no good jokes , no good scenes , barely a moment when Carvey 's Saturday Night Live-honed mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment .	disgust	moviereview
7493	Jacquot 's rendering of Puccini 's tale of devotion and double-cross is more than just a filmed opera .	joy	moviereview
7494	In his first stab at the form , Jacquot takes a slightly anarchic approach that works only sporadically .	disgust	moviereview
7495	Chabrol has taken promising material for a black comedy and turned it instead into a somber chamber drama .	disgust	moviereview
7496	It 's as if you 're watching a movie that was made in 1978 but not released then because it was so weak , and it has been unearthed and released now , when it has become even weaker .	disgust	moviereview
7497	This is nothing but familiar territory .	disgust	moviereview
7498	In execution , this clever idea is far less funny than the original , Killers From Space .	disgust	moviereview
7499	One of the more irritating cartoons you will see this , or any , year .	disgust	moviereview
7500	A broad , melodramatic estrogen opera that 's pretty toxic in its own right .	disgust	moviereview
7501	Too slow , too long and too little happens .	disgust	moviereview
7502	The film 's few ideas are stretched to the point of evaporation ; the whole central section is one big chase that seems to have no goal and no urgency .	disgust	moviereview
7503	It 's just filler .	disgust	moviereview
7504	Sacrifices the value of its wealth of archival foot-age with its less-than-objective stance .	disgust	moviereview
7505	Utterly lacking in charm , wit and invention , Roberto Benigni 's Pinocchio is an astonishingly bad film .	disgust	moviereview
7506	A hamfisted romantic comedy that makes our girl the hapless facilitator of an extended cheap shot across the Mason-Dixon line .	disgust	moviereview
7507	Scores no points for originality , wit , or intelligence .	disgust	moviereview
7508	It 's a cookie-cutter movie , a cut-and-paste job .	disgust	moviereview
7509	They takes a long time to get to its gasp-inducing ending .	disgust	moviereview
7510	Barely gets off the ground .	disgust	moviereview
7511	Even on those rare occasions when the narrator stops yammering , Miller 's hand often feels unsure .	disgust	moviereview
7512	Pumpkin means to be an outrageous dark satire on fraternity life , but its ambitions far exceed the abilities of writer Adam Larson Broder and his co-director , Tony R. Abrams , in their feature debut .	disgust	moviereview
7513	At its best , Queen is campy fun like the Vincent Price horror classics of the 60s .	joy	moviereview
7514	At its worst , it implodes in a series of very bad special effects .	disgust	moviereview
7515	From the opening scenes , it 's clear that All About the Benjamins is a totally formulaic movie .	disgust	moviereview
7516	It takes a certain kind of horror movie to qualify as ` worse than expected , ' but Ghost Ship somehow manages to do exactly that .	disgust	moviereview
7517	On the bright side , it contains Jesse Ventura 's best work since the XFL .	joy	moviereview
7518	Despite impeccable acting ... and a script that takes some rather unexpected -LRB- even , at times , preposterous -RRB- turns , Love is just too , too precious in the end .	joy	moviereview
7519	A TV style murder mystery with a few big screen moments -LRB- including one that seems to be made for a different film altogether -RRB- .	noemotion	moviereview
7520	By getting myself wrapped up in the visuals and eccentricities of many of the characters , I found myself confused when it came time to get to the heart of the movie .	disgust	moviereview
7521	Too often , the viewer is n't reacting to humor so much as they are wincing back in repugnance .	disgust	moviereview
7522	Dilbert without the right-on satiric humor .	disgust	moviereview
7523	Manages to show life in all of its banality when the intention is quite the opposite .	disgust	moviereview
7524	Do not see this film .	disgust	moviereview
7525	Minority Report is exactly what the title indicates , a report .	noemotion	moviereview
7526	Delivers the same old same old , tarted up with Latin flava and turned out by Hollywood playas .	disgust	moviereview
7527	If you believe any of this , I can make you a real deal on leftover Enron stock that will double in value a week from Friday .	disgust	moviereview
7528	To call The Other Side of Heaven `` appalling '' would be to underestimate just how dangerous entertainments like it can be .	disgust	moviereview
7529	In exactly 89 minutes , most of which passed as slowly as if I 'd been sitting naked on an igloo , Formula 51 sank from quirky to jerky to utter turkey .	disgust	moviereview
7530	If only the story about a multi-million dollar con bothered to include the con .	disgust	moviereview
7531	I 'd have to say the star and director are the big problems here .	disgust	moviereview
7532	Without the dark spookiness of Crystal Lake Camp , the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace .	disgust	moviereview
7533	It 's like every bad idea that 's ever gone into an after-school special compiled in one place , minus those daytime programs ' slickness and sophistication -LRB- and who knew they even had any ? -RRB- .	disgust	moviereview
7534	While the Resident Evil games may have set new standards for thrills , suspense , and gore for video games , the movie really only succeeds in the third of these .	disgust	moviereview
7535	For close to two hours the audience is forced to endure three terminally depressed , mostly inarticulate , hyper dysfunctional families for the price of one .	disgust	moviereview
7536	To my taste , the film 's comic characters come perilously close to being Amoses and Andys for a new generation .	disgust	moviereview
7537	What the director ca n't do is make either of Val Kilmer 's two personas interesting or worth caring about .	disgust	moviereview
7538	In an effort , I suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishy-washy .	disgust	moviereview
7539	It 's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script , but here 's guessing that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role .	disgust	moviereview
7540	Harland Williams is so funny in drag he should consider permanent sex-reassignment .	joy	moviereview

7876	I felt sad for Lise not so much because of what happens as because she was captured by this movie when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier , by Rohmer , for example .	sadness	moviereview
7877	Prurient playthings aside , there 's little to love about this English trifle .	disgust	moviereview
7878	This is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed James Bond into the mindless XXX mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs .	disgust	moviereview
7879	The film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle .	disgust	moviereview

7902	it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so	disgust	moviereview
7903	It 's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface .	sadness	moviereview

8424	Despite a powerful portrayal by Binoche , it 's a period romance that suffers from an overly deliberate pace and uneven narrative momentum .	disgust	moviereview
8425	The picture is a primer on what happens when lack of know-how mixes with lack of give-a-damn .	disgust	moviereview
8426	Bartleby is a one-joke movie , and a bad joke at that .	disgust	moviereview
8427	Given that both movies expect us to root for convicted violent felons over those assigned to protect us from same , we need every bit of sympathy the cons can muster ; this time , there is n't much .	disgust	moviereview
8428	A bravura exercise in emptiness .	disgust	moviereview
8429	Philip K. Dick must be turning in his grave , along with my stomach .	disgust	moviereview
8430	Despite the premise of a good story ... it wastes all its star power on cliched or meaningless roles .	disgust	moviereview
8431	All prints of this film should be sent to and buried on Pluto .	disgust	moviereview
8432	Not only does the movie fail to make us part of its reality , it fails the most basic relevancy test as well .	disgust	moviereview
8433	First good , then bothersome .	disgust	moviereview
8434	Excellent acting and direction .	joy	moviereview
8435	This goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crime-busting comic vehicle -- a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring	disgust	moviereview
8436	It 's difficult to say whether The Tuxedo is more boring or embarrassing -- I 'm prepared to call it a draw .	disgust	moviereview
8437	Even as lame horror flicks go , this is lame .	disgust	moviereview
8438	So routine , familiar and predictable , it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as a newly automated Final Draft computer program .	disgust	moviereview
8439	Sunshine State lacks the kind of dynamic that Limbo offers , and in some ways is a rather indulgent piece .	disgust	moviereview
8440	Even legends like Alfred Hitchcock and John Huston occasionally directed trifles ... so it 's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like Zhang Yimou behind the camera for a yarn that 's ultimately rather inconsequential .	disgust	moviereview
8441	A long-winded , predictable scenario .	disgust	moviereview
8442	Too close to Phantom Menace for comfort .	disgust	moviereview
8443	Although trying to balance self-referential humor and a normal ol slasher plot seemed like a decent endeavor , the result does n't fully satisfy either the die-hard Jason fans or those who can take a good joke .	disgust	moviereview
8444	Too clunky and too busy ribbing itself to be truly entertaining .	disgust	moviereview
8445	This movie is about lying , cheating , but loving the friends you betray .	noemotion	moviereview
8446	It smacks of purely commercial motivation , with no great love for the original .	disgust	moviereview
8447	Melanie eventually slugs the Yankee .	noemotion	moviereview

8451	A well-made , thoughtful , well-acted clunker , but a clunker nonetheless .	disgust	moviereview
8452	A dreary rip-off of Goodfellas that serves as a muddled and offensive cautionary tale for Hispanic Americans .	disgust	moviereview
8453	The picture , scored by a perversely cheerful Marcus Miller accordion/harmonica/banjo abomination , is a monument to bad in all its florid variety .	disgust	moviereview
8454	Good for a few unintentional laughs , `` Extreme Ops '' was obviously made for the `` XXX '' crowd , people who enjoy mindless action without the benefit of decent acting , writing , and direction .	disgust	moviereview
8455	... a big , baggy , sprawling carnival of a movie , stretching out before us with little rhyme or reason .	disgust	moviereview
8456	A frustrating combination of strained humor and heavy-handed sentimentality .	disgust	moviereview
8457	Lawrence preaches strictly to the converted .	noemotion	moviereview

8459	Will probably stay in the shadow of its two older , more accessible Qatsi siblings .	sadness	moviereview
8460	Just when the movie seems confident enough to handle subtlety , it dives into soapy bathos .	disgust	moviereview
8461	Choppy editing and too many repetitive scenes spoil what could have been an important documentary about stand-up comedy .	disgust	moviereview
8462	... the film falls back on the same old formula of teen sex , outrageous pranks and scenes designed to push the envelope of bad taste for laughs .	disgust	moviereview
8463	The only thing in Pauline and Paulette that you have n't seen before is a scene featuring a football field-sized Oriental rug crafted out of millions of vibrant flowers .	disgust	moviereview
8464	If you 're looking for comedy to be served up , better look elsewhere .	disgust	moviereview
8465	It virtually defines a comedy that 's strongly mediocre , with funny bits surfacing every once in a while .	disgust	moviereview
8466	An instant candidate for worst movie of the year .	disgust	moviereview
8467	Despite its title , Amy 's Orgasm is not a porno , though it is as tedious as one .	disgust	moviereview
8468	Like a tone-deaf singer at a benefit concert , John Q. is a bad movie appearing on behalf of a good cause .	disgust	moviereview
8469	Adam Sandler is to Gary Cooper what a gnat is to a racehorse .	disgust	moviereview

8473	Without September 11 , Collateral Damage would have been just another bad movie .	disgust	moviereview
8474	Now it 's a bad , embarrassing movie .	disgust	moviereview
8475	Drags along in a dazed and enervated , drenched-in-the - past numbness .	disgust	moviereview
8476	There 's a disturbing ` Great White Hope ' undertone to The Other Side of Heaven that subtly undermines its message of Christian love and compassion .	sadness	moviereview
8477	Unless you are in dire need of a Diesel fix , there is no real reason to see it .	disgust	moviereview
8478	Wait for video -- and then do n't rent it .	disgust	moviereview
8479	The attempt is courageous , even if the result is wildly uneven .	joy	moviereview
8480	There 's something fundamental missing from this story : something or someone to care about .	sadness	moviereview
8481	Too much of this well-acted but dangerously slow thriller feels like a preamble to a bigger , more complicated story , one that never materializes .	disgust	moviereview
8482	When a film is created SOLELY because it 's a marketable product , soulless and ugly movies like this are the result .	disgust	moviereview
8483	Let your silly childhood nostalgia slumber unmolested .	disgust	moviereview
8484	Unfortunately , Heartbreak Hospital wants to convey the same kind of haughtiness in its own sketchy material but this territory has already been explored previously with better aplomb and sardonic wit .	disgust	moviereview
8485	The more Kevin Costner rests on his pretty-boy laurels , the public is , regrettably , going to have tepid films like Dragonfly tossed at them .	disgust	moviereview
8486	-LRB- It 's -RRB- difficult to get beyond the overall blandness of American Chai , despite its likable performances and refreshingly naive point of view .	disgust	moviereview
8487	The latest installment in the Pokemon canon , Pokemon 4ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two , likely because much of the Japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where Pokemon graze in peace .	surprise	moviereview
8488	Taken purely as an exercise in style , this oppressively gloomy techno-horror clambake is impossible to ignore .	disgust	moviereview
8489	But as a movie , it 's a humorless , disjointed mess .	disgust	moviereview
8490	If Myers decides to make another Austin Powers movie , maybe he should just stick with Austin and Dr Evil .	disgust	moviereview
8491	The backyard battles you staged with your green plastic army men were more exciting and almost certainly made more sense .	disgust	moviereview
8492	Too stupid to be satire , too obviously hateful to be classified otherwise , Frank Novak 's irritating slice of lumpen life is as reliably soul-killing as its title is nearly meaningless .	disgust	moviereview
8493	Overly stylized with lots of flash black - & - white freeze frames reminiscent of a pseudo-hip luxury car commercial , -LRB- it 's -RRB- at its worst when it 's actually inside the ring .	disgust	moviereview
8494	What is captured during the conceptual process does n't add up to a sufficient explanation of what the final dance work , The Selection , became in its final form .	disgust	moviereview
8495	If this is satire , it 's the smug and self-congratulatory kind that lets the audience completely off the hook .	disgust	moviereview
8496	Had the film boasted a clearer , more memorable , the creepiness would have gotten under the skin .	disgust	moviereview
8497	These people would n't know subtle characterization if it put on a giant furry monster costume and then gave them a lapdance .	disgust	moviereview
8498	Imagine if you will a Tony Hawk skating video interspliced with footage from Behind Enemy Lines and set to Jersey shore techno .	disgust	moviereview
8499	It does n't quite work , but there 's enough here to make us look forward to the Russos ' next offering .	anticipation	moviereview
8500	Any film featuring young children threatened by a terrorist bomb can no longer pass as mere entertainment .	disgust	moviereview
8501	The director 's twitchy sketchbook style and adroit perspective shifts grow wearisome amid leaden pacing and indifferent craftsmanship -LRB- most notably wretched sound design -RRB- .	disgust	moviereview
8502	About as satisfying and predictable as the fare at your local drive through .	disgust	moviereview
8503	Apparently kissing leads to suicide attempts and tragic deaths .	surprise	moviereview
8504	Marisa Tomei is good , but Just A Kiss is just a mess .	disgust	moviereview
8505	Opens at a funeral , ends on the protagonist 's death bed and does n't get much livelier in the three hours in between .	disgust	moviereview
8506	The noble tradition of men in drag hits an all-time low in Sorority Boys , whose makers apparently believe that women 's clothing can cover up any deficiency in acting , writing or direction .	disgust	moviereview
8507	To portray modern women the way director Davis has done is just unthinkable .	disgust	moviereview
8508	Too simple for its own good .	disgust	moviereview
8509	Flaccid drama and exasperatingly slow journey .	disgust	moviereview
8510	A chaotic panorama that 's too busy flying a lot of metaphoric flags .	disgust	moviereview
8511	Suffers from rambling , repetitive dialogue and the visual drabness endemic to digital video .	disgust	moviereview
8512	The screenplay sabotages the movie 's strengths at almost every juncture .	disgust	moviereview
8513	All the characters are stereotypes , and their interaction is numbingly predictable .	disgust	moviereview
8514	A trashy , exploitative , thoroughly unpleasant experience .	disgust	moviereview
8515	Newcomer helmer Kevin Donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept -- a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman .	disgust	moviereview
8516	Should n't have been allowed to use the word `` new '' in its title , because there 's not an original character , siuation or joke in the entire movie .	disgust	moviereview
8517	Often silly -- and gross -- but it 's rarely as moronic as some campus gross-out films .	disgust	moviereview
8518	The advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap .	disgust	moviereview
8519	Any rock pile will do for a set .	noemotion	moviereview
8520	Reign of Fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap .	disgust	moviereview
8521	The performances are so leaden , Michael Rymer 's direction is so bloodless and the dialogue is so corny that the audience laughs out loud .	disgust	moviereview
8522	A subtle variation on I Spit On Your Grave in which our purported heroine pathologically avenges a hatred for men .	noemotion	moviereview
8523	Reggio 's trippy , ambitious downer can also sometimes come across like nothing more than a glorified Nike ad .	disgust	moviereview
8524	As Tweedy talks about canning his stockbroker and repairing his pool , you yearn for a few airborne TV sets or nude groupies on the nod to liven things up .	disgust	moviereview
8525	If somebody was bored and ... decided to make a dull , pretentious version of Jesus ' Son , they 'd come up with something like Bart Freundlich 's World Traveler .	disgust	moviereview
8526	The best you can say about it is it 's so uninspired , it barely gives one pause when considering some of the other dreck out there right now .	disgust	moviereview
8527	A tough go , but Leigh 's depth and rigor , and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their lack of showiness , offsets to a notable degree the film 's often-mined and despairing milieu .	joy	moviereview
8528	An overstuffed compendium of teen-Catholic-movie dogma .	disgust	moviereview
8529	Too leisurely paced and visually drab for its own good , it succeeds in being only sporadically amusing .	disgust	moviereview
8530	Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan , Tom Clancy 's intrepid hero ?	noemotion	moviereview
8531	Ridiculous .	disgust	moviereview

8533	D.J. Qualls as Indiana Jones ?	noemotion	moviereview
8534	Or Tom Green as Han Solo ?	noemotion	moviereview
8535	The movie 's biggest offense is its complete and utter lack of tension .	disgust	moviereview
8536	The film is directed by Wally Wolodarsky from a script by Joe Jarvis and Greg Coolidge .	noemotion	moviereview
8537	These are names to remember , in order to avoid them in the future .	disgust	moviereview
8538	If this is the resurrection of the Halloween franchise , it would have been better off dead .	disgust	moviereview
8539	This formulaic chiller will do little to boost Stallone 's career .	disgust	moviereview
8540	I saw Knockaround Guys yesterday , and already the details have faded like photographs from the Spanish-American War ... It 's so unmemorable that it turned my ballpoint notes to invisible ink .	disgust	moviereview
8541	Though Avary has done his best to make something out of Ellis ' nothing novel , in the end , his Rules is barely worth following .	disgust	moviereview
8542	The average local news columnist has a bigger rant on the war between modern landscape architecture and small-town America .	disgust	moviereview
8543	No worse than a lot of the crap we 've been offered this summer , and slightly better than Men in Black 2 as far as slapdash extraterrestrial comedies go .	disgust	moviereview
8544	The plot is so predictable and sentimental that viewers are likely to lose interest before Sandrine and her goats walk off into the sunset .	disgust	moviereview
8545	At first , the sight of a blind man directing a film is hilarious , but as the film goes on , the joke wears thin .	disgust	moviereview
8546	Never Again swings between false sentiment and unfunny madcap comedy and , along the way , expects the audience to invest in the central relationship as some kind of marriage of true minds .	disgust	moviereview
8547	the story itself is uninteresting , and the songs are painfully undistinguished : They Might Be Giants ' So to Be One of Us may be the most tuneless tune ever composed .	disgust	moviereview
8548	Technically , the film is about as interesting as an insurance commercial .	disgust	moviereview
8549	The title 's lameness should clue you in on how bad the movie is .	disgust	moviereview
8550	The parts are better than the whole -LRB- bizarre , funny , tragic - like love in New York -RRB- .	joy	moviereview
8551	While the film shuns the glamour or glitz that an American movie might demand , Scherfig tosses us a romantic scenario that is just as simplistic as a Hollywood production .	joy	moviereview
8552	The humor is hinged on the belief that knees in the crotch , elbows in the face and spit in the eye are inherently funny .	disgust	moviereview
8553	It 's a movie forged in the fires of Chick Flick Hell .	disgust	moviereview
8554	Its characters are thinner than cardboard -- or even comic-book paper .	disgust	moviereview
8555	Any one episode of The Sopranos would send this ill-conceived folly to sleep with the fishes .	disgust	moviereview
8556	Feels like the grittiest movie that was ever made for the Lifetime cable television network .	joy	moviereview
8557	Lanie 's professional success means she must be a failure at life , because she 's driven by ambition and Does n't Know How to Have Fun .	disgust	moviereview
8558	Credit must be given to Harland Williams , Michael Rosenbaum and Barry Watson , who inject far more good-natured spirit and talent into this project than it deserves	joy	moviereview
8559	Denzel Washington 's efforts are sunk by all the sanctimony .	disgust	moviereview
8560	If this holiday movie is supposed to be a gift , somebody unwrapped it early , took out all the good stuff , and left behind the crap -LRB- literally -RRB- .	disgust	moviereview
8561	So faithful to the doldrums of the not-quite-urban , not-quite-suburban milieu as to have viewers recoiling from the reality check .	disgust	moviereview
8562	Rambles on in a disjointed , substandard fashion from one poorly executed action sequence to the next .	disgust	moviereview
8563	There 's an audience for it , but it could have been funnier and more innocent .	disgust	moviereview
8564	I can only imagine one thing worse than Kevin Spacey trying on an Irish accent , and that 's sultry Linda Fiorentino doing the same thing .	disgust	moviereview
8565	An awkward and indigestible movie .	disgust	moviereview
8566	The movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs .	disgust	moviereview
8567	Haneke keeps us at arm 's length .	noemotion	moviereview
8568	Guided more by intellect than heart , his story flattens instead of sharpens .	disgust	moviereview
8569	All the well-meaningness in the world ca n't erase the fact that The Believer feels like a 12-Step Program for the Jewish Nazi .	disgust	moviereview
8570	Like most sequels , it takes what worked last time , repeats it and adds more characters , more stunts , more stuff in attempt to camouflage its sameness .	disgust	moviereview
8571	There 's no way to sort out the mess in our heads and deconstruct where it all went wrong .	disgust	moviereview
8572	This is an hour and a half of daydreaming .	disgust	moviereview
8573	Message movie or an action-packed submarine spectacular ?	noemotion	moviereview
8574	Alas , it 's neither .	noemotion	moviereview
8575	No movement , no yuks , not much of anything .	disgust	moviereview
8576	` Dragonfly ' is a movie about a bus wreck that turns into a film wreck .	disgust	moviereview
8577	Thirty years ago , it would have been groundbreaking .	noemotion	moviereview
8578	Now it 's just tired .	disgust	moviereview
8579	Heavy-handed exercise in time-vaulting literary pretension .	disgust	moviereview
8580	The movie is too cute to take itself too seriously , but it still feels like it was made by some very stoned college students .	disgust	moviereview
8581	A thinly veiled excuse for Wilson to play his self-deprecating act against Murphy 's well-honed prima donna shtick .	disgust	moviereview
8582	A minor picture with a major identity crisis -- it 's sort of true and it 's sort of bogus and it 's ho-hum all the way through .	disgust	moviereview
8583	The movie succumbs to being nothing more than a formulaic chase in the dark .	disgust	moviereview
8584	Plays as hollow catharsis , with lots of tears but very little in the way of insights .	disgust	moviereview
8585	It will come as no surprise that the movie is n't scary .	noemotion	moviereview
8586	But here 's the real damn : It is n't funny , either .	disgust	moviereview
8587	Quick : who wants to see a comedy about shoddy airport security ?	disgust	moviereview
8588	The reason I found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory .	disgust	moviereview
8589	What you get with Empire is a movie you 've seen many times before , repackaged as new material because there is a Latino in the lead .	noemotion	moviereview
8590	Cho 's fans are sure to be entertained ; it 's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- I 'm not one of them .	disgust	moviereview
8591	Looks awfully like one long tourist spot for a Mississippi that may never have existed outside of a scriptwriter 's imagination .	disgust	moviereview
8592	The period -- swinging London in the time of the mods and the rockers -- gets the once-over once again in Gangster No. 1 , but falls apart long before the end .	disgust	moviereview
8593	High Crimes miscasts nearly every leading character .	disgust	moviereview
8594	The overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there 's still a real sense that the Star Trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction .	disgust	moviereview
8595	De Niro looks bored , Murphy recycles Murphy , and you mentally add Showtime to the pile of Hollywood dreck that represents nothing more than the art of the deal .	disgust	moviereview
8596	I did n't believe for a moment in these villains or their plot .	disgust	moviereview
8597	Another rent installment for the Ian Fleming estate .	noemotion	moviereview
8598	With Danilo Donati 's witty designs and Dante Spinotti 's luscious cinematography , this might have made a decent children 's movie -- if only Benigni had n't insisted on casting himself in the title role .	disgust	moviereview
8599	So lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft-core imagery with naughty fun .	disgust	moviereview
8600	Though it draws several decent laughs , it 's low-cal Woody at best .	sadness	moviereview
8601	Has little on its mind aside from scoring points with drag gags .	disgust	moviereview
8602	Britney 's performance can not be faulted .	joy	moviereview
8603	Lucy 's a dull girl , that 's all .	disgust	moviereview
8604	Well-shot but badly written tale set in a future ravaged by dragons .	disgust	moviereview
8605	Sadly , Hewitt 's forte is leaning forward while wearing low-cut gowns , not making snappy comebacks .	sadness	moviereview
8606	If Melville is creatively a great whale , this film is canned tuna .	disgust	moviereview
8607	This film is so slick , superficial and trend-hoppy , that it 's easy to imagine that a new software program spit out the screenplay .	disgust	moviereview
8608	Just one more collection of penis , breast and flatulence gags in search of a story .	anticipation	moviereview
8609	Or a profit .	noemotion	moviereview
8610	Or some damn thing .	disgust	moviereview
8611	The acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from Gilligan 's Island -- and the CGI Scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year .	disgust	moviereview
8612	Enough trivializes an important crisis , reduces it to an almost comic embarrassment .	disgust	moviereview
8613	The makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and , instead , rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep .	disgust	moviereview
8614	I like Frank the Pug , though .	joy	moviereview
8615	A restrained Ribisi convinces as an Italian , though if ever a movie needed one of the actor 's whiny jags to pump it up , this has to be among the rare ones .	noemotion	moviereview
8616	Gee , a second assassin shot Kennedy ?	surprise	moviereview
8617	Moot point .	noemotion	moviereview
8618	A hysterical yet humorless disquisition on the thin line between sucking face and literally sucking face .	disgust	moviereview
8619	Needless to say , the dramatics that follow are utter hooey .	disgust	moviereview
8620	The problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise , Mr. Desplechin is content to state it .	disgust	moviereview
8621	Madonna still ca n't act a lick .	disgust	moviereview
8622	Even the imaginative gore ca n't hide the musty scent of Todd Farmer 's screenplay , which is a simple retread of the 1979 Alien , with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship .	disgust	moviereview
8623	If you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce .	disgust	moviereview
8624	The episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life .	joy	moviereview
8625	But the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored .	disgust	moviereview
8626	Serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in America in 2002 .	joy	moviereview
8627	But hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour .	disgust	moviereview
8628	Do n't let your festive spirit go this far .	disgust	moviereview
8629	Though the book runs only about 300 pages , it is so densely packed ... that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like Mr. Schepisi 's seems skimpy and unclear .	disgust	moviereview
8630	Hey , at least the title of this film lets you know exactly where it 's heading .	disgust	moviereview
8631	Intended to be a comedy about relationships , this wretched work falls flat in just about every conceivable area .	disgust	moviereview
8632	Sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary .	disgust	moviereview
8633	Director Brian Levant , who never strays far from his sitcom roots , skates blithely from one implausible situation to another , pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows than you 'll find on a French poodle .	disgust	moviereview
8634	... perhaps the heaviest , most joyless movie ever made about giant dragons taking over the world .	disgust	moviereview
8635	Suggests puns about ingredients and soup and somebody being off their noodle , but let 's just say the ingredients do n't quite add up to a meal .	disgust	moviereview
8636	I 'd give real money to see the perpetrators of Chicago torn apart by dingoes .	anger	moviereview
8637	Movies like this are selling the old European candor , the old wink of ` bold ' revelation .	joy	moviereview
8638	But in 2002 , such revelations wilt .	sadness	moviereview
8639	The timing in nearly every scene seems a half beat off .	disgust	moviereview
8640	I admire it and yet can not recommend it , because it overstays its natural running time .	disgust	moviereview
8641	A fairly by-the-books blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy .	noemotion	moviereview
8642	Flounders due to the general sense that no two people working on the production had exactly the same thing in mind .	disgust	moviereview

8668	The issue of faith is not explored very deeply	disgust	moviereview
8669	It 's a bad sign when you 're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects ' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it 's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest .	disgust	moviereview

8716	Places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller .	disgust	moviereview
8717	Stephen Earnhart 's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition -- wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text -- when it 's really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type .	disgust	moviereview
8718	A very average science fiction film .	noemotion	moviereview

8732	For all of the contemporary post-colonialist consciousness that Kapur tries to bring to The Four Feathers , the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear .	disgust	moviereview

8734	What The Four Feathers lacks is genuine sweep or feeling or even a character worth caring about .	disgust	moviereview

8739	None of these characters resembles anyone you 've ever met in real life , unless you happen to know annoyingly self-involved people who speak in glib sentences that could have only come from the pen of a screenwriter .	disgust	moviereview
8740	... just a big mess of a movie , full of images and events , but no tension or surprise .	disgust	moviereview
8741	As elegantly crafted as it often is , Anderson 's movie is essentially a one-trick pony that , hampered by an undeveloped script , ultimately pulls up lame .	disgust	moviereview

8754	Most of the action setups are incoherent .	disgust	moviereview
8755	Liman , of Swingers and Go , makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long , low-heat chase , interrupted by a middling car chase .	disgust	moviereview
8756	... surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs .	surprise	moviereview
8757	The problem is n't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of Schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball .	disgust	moviereview
8758	Dreary , highly annoying ... ` Some Body ' will appeal to No One .	disgust	moviereview
8759	There 's something deeply creepy about Never Again , a new arrow in Schaeffer 's quiver of ineptitudes .	disgust	moviereview
8760	The problem with concept films is that if the concept is a poor one , there 's no saving the movie .	disgust	moviereview

8765	The cartoon that is n't really good enough to be on afternoon TV is now a movie that is n't really good enough to be in theaters .	disgust	moviereview
8766	Shocking only in that it reveals the filmmaker 's bottomless pit of self-absorption .	disgust	moviereview
8767	This pep-talk for faith , hope and charity does little to offend , but if saccharine earnestness were a crime , the film 's producers would be in the clink for life .	disgust	moviereview

8770	Formula 51 is so trite that even Yu 's high-energy action stylings ca n't break through the stupor .	disgust	moviereview
8771	Only a few minutes elapse before the daddy of all slashers arrives , still with the boiler suit and white mask , which look remarkably clean for a guy who has been mass-murdering since 1978 but has never been seen doing laundry .	noemotion	moviereview
8772	When the painted backdrops in a movie are more alive than its characters , you know you 're in trouble .	disgust	moviereview

8786	While Super Troopers is above Academy standards , its quintet of writers could still use some more schooling .	disgust	moviereview
8787	A mix of velocity and idiocy , this ruinous remake lacks the brawn -- and the brains -- of the 1970s original .	disgust	moviereview
8788	The low-budget Full Frontal was one of the year 's murkiest , intentionally obscure and self-indulgent pictures , and Solaris is its big-budget brother .	disgust	moviereview
8789	The plot is very clever , but Boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events , all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of .	disgust	moviereview
8790	The film seems all but destined to pop up on a television screen in the background of a scene in a future Quentin Tarantino picture	noemotion	moviereview
8791	A free-for-all of half-baked thoughts , clumsily used visual tricks and self-indulgent actor moments .	disgust	moviereview
8792	Apallingly absurd ... the chemistry or lack thereof between Newton and Wahlberg could turn an Imax theater into a 9 '' black and white portable TV .	disgust	moviereview

8838	Uneasy mishmash of styles and genres .	noemotion	moviereview
8839	Herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among Germany and Eastern European Jews might have changed 20th-Century history is undermined by Ahola 's inadequate performance .	disgust	moviereview

9158	It 's so tedious that it makes you forgive every fake , dishonest , entertaining and , ultimately , more perceptive moment in Bridget Jones 's Diary .	disgust	moviereview
9159	Almost as offensive as `` Freddy Got Fingered . ''	disgust	moviereview
9160	The gifted Crudup has the perfect face to play a handsome blank yearning to find himself , and his cipherlike personality and bad behavior would play fine if the movie knew what to do with him .	disgust	moviereview

9168	Originality is sorely lacking .	disgust	moviereview
9169	The plot 's clearly mythic structure may owe more to Disney 's strong sense of formula than to the original story .	joy	moviereview

9172	Ram Dass Fierce Grace moulds itself as an example to up-and-coming documentarians , of the overlooked pitfalls of such an endeavour .	joy	moviereview
9173	Lucky Break is perfectly inoffensive and harmless , but it 's also drab and inert .	disgust	moviereview
9174	For a story set at sea , Ghost Ship is pretty landbound , with its leaden acting , dull exposition and telegraphed ` surprises . '	disgust	moviereview

9182	` Sophisticated ' viewers who refuse to admit that they do n't like it will likely call it ` challenging ' to their fellow sophisticates .	disgust	moviereview
9183	Equilibrium the movie , as opposed to the manifesto , is really , really stupid .	disgust	moviereview
9184	Excruciatingly unfunny and pitifully unromantic .	disgust	moviereview
9185	The film 's thoroughly recycled plot and tiresome jokes ... drag the movie down .	disgust	moviereview
9186	It does n't offer audiences any way of gripping what its point is , or even its attitude toward its subject .	sadness	moviereview
9187	This kiddie-oriented stinker is so bad that I even caught the gum stuck under my seat trying to sneak out of the theater	disgust	moviereview
9188	Though Impostor deviously adopts the guise of a modern motion picture , it too is a bomb .	disgust	moviereview

9212	Even if you 're an Elvis person , you wo n't find anything to get excited about on this DVD .	disgust	moviereview
9213	The movie certainly has its share of clever moments and biting dialogue , but there 's just not much lurking below its abstract surface .	disgust	moviereview
9214	It 's bedeviled by labored writing and slack direction .	disgust	moviereview
9215	I 'm sure there 's a teenage boy out there somewhere who 's dying for this kind of entertainment .	disgust	moviereview
9216	The Tuxedo miscalculates badly by forcing the star to play second fiddle to the dull effects that allow the suit to come to life .	disgust	moviereview
9217	The film is a confusing melange of tones and styles , one moment a romantic trifle and the next a turgid drama .	disgust	moviereview
9218	Obviously , a lot of people wasted a lot of their time -LRB- including mine -RRB- on something very inconsequential .	disgust	moviereview

9224	There 's got to be a more graceful way of portraying the devastation of this disease .	disgust	moviereview

9226	The modern-day characters are nowhere near as vivid as the 19th-century ones .	disgust	moviereview
9227	Blessed with a searing lead performance by Ryan Gosling -LRB- Murder by Numbers -RRB- , the movie is powerful and provocative .	joy	moviereview
9228	It 's also built on a faulty premise , one it follows into melodrama and silliness .	disgust	moviereview
9229	Uneven performances and a spotty script add up to a biting satire that has no teeth .	disgust	moviereview
9230	Director Jay Russell stomps in hobnail boots over Natalie Babbitt 's gentle , endearing 1975 children 's novel .	disgust	moviereview

9235	Kicks off with an inauspicious premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper .	disgust	moviereview
9236	A rote exercise in both animation and storytelling .	disgust	moviereview
9237	The material and the production itself are little more than routine .	disgust	moviereview
9238	The movie 's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula , though , and it 's quite enough to lessen the overall impact the movie could have had .	disgust	moviereview

9945	Something must have been lost in the translation .	noemotion	moviereview
9946	Becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any Plympton film : boring .	disgust	moviereview
9947	In the end , the film feels homogenized and a bit contrived , as if we 're looking back at a tattered and ugly past with rose-tinted glasses .	disgust	moviereview
9948	Chan 's stunts are limited and so embellished by editing that there 's really not much of a sense of action or even action-comedy .	disgust	moviereview
9949	Rock 's stand-up magic wanes .	disgust	moviereview
9950	Hopkins , squarely fills the screen .	joy	moviereview
9951	Action - mechanical .	noemotion	moviereview
9952	`` The Tuxedo '' should have been the vehicle for Chan that `` The Mask '' was for Jim Carrey .	disgust	moviereview
9953	Alas , it 's the man that makes the clothes .	noemotion	moviereview
9954	For casual moviegoers who stumble into Rules expecting a slice of American Pie hijinks starring the kid from Dawson 's Creek , they 'll probably run out screaming .	disgust	moviereview
9955	The biggest problem I have -LRB- other than the very sluggish pace -RRB- is we never really see her Esther blossom as an actress , even though her talent is supposed to be growing .	disgust	moviereview
9956	What puzzles me is the lack of emphasis on music in Britney Spears ' first movie .	surprise	moviereview
9957	Plot , characters , drama , emotions , ideas -- all are irrelevant to the experience of seeing The Scorpion King .	disgust	moviereview
9958	City by the Sea is a gritty police thriller with all the dysfunctional family dynamics one could wish for .	joy	moviereview
9959	But how it washed out despite all of that is the project 's prime mystery .	disgust	moviereview
9960	Whatever the movie 's sentimental , hypocritical lessons about sexism , its true colors come out in various wet T-shirt and shower scenes .	disgust	moviereview
9961	As a hybrid teen thriller and murder mystery , Murder by Numbers fits the profile too closely .	disgust	moviereview
9962	There ai n't a lot more painful than an unfunny movie that thinks it 's hilarious .	disgust	moviereview
9963	I enjoyed the movie in a superficial way , while never sure what its purpose was .	joy	moviereview
9964	What a pity ... that the material is so second-rate .	disgust	moviereview
9965	Does n't deliver a great story , nor is the action as gripping as in past Seagal films .	disgust	moviereview
9966	The kind of film that leaves you scratching your head in amazement over the fact that so many talented people could participate in such an ill-advised and poorly executed idea .	disgust	moviereview
9967	Nicks refuses to let Slackers be seen as just another teen movie , which means he can be forgiven for frequently pandering to fans of the gross-out comedy .	joy	moviereview
9968	Nothing about the film -- with the possible exception of Elizabeth Hurley 's breasts -- is authentic .	disgust	moviereview
9969	Amid the clich and foreshadowing , Cage manages a degree of casual realism ... that is routinely dynamited by Blethyn .	noemotion	moviereview
9970	Mostly , Shafer and co-writer Gregory Hinton lack a strong-minded viewpoint , or a sense of humor .	disgust	moviereview
9971	No cliche escapes the perfervid treatment of gang warfare called ces Wild .	disgust	moviereview
9972	Eddie Murphy and Owen Wilson have a cute partnership in I Spy , but the movie around them is so often nearly nothing that their charm does n't do a load of good .	disgust	moviereview
9973	Strictly a ` guy 's film ' in the worst sense of the expression .	disgust	moviereview
9974	There 's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life , but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes .	disgust	moviereview
9975	It 's a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as Phoenix 's .	disgust	moviereview
9976	There 's something fishy about a seasonal holiday kids ' movie ... that derives its moment of most convincing emotional gravity from a scene where Santa gives gifts to grownups .	disgust	moviereview
9977	We 're left with a story that tries to grab us , only to keep letting go at all the wrong moments .	disgust	moviereview
9978	Like many such biographical melodramas , it suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories .	disgust	moviereview
9979	There is nothing redeeming about this movie .	disgust	moviereview
9980	The film has -LRB- its -RRB- moments , but they are few and far between .	disgust	moviereview
9981	I was trying to decide what annoyed me most about God is Great ... I 'm Not , and then I realized that I just did n't care .	disgust	moviereview
9982	Derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post-production reworking to aim the film at young males in the throes of their first full flush of testosterone .	disgust	moviereview
9983	Deserves high marks for political courage but barely gets by on its artistic merits .	disgust	moviereview
9984	... comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental .	joy	moviereview
9985	Brosnan 's finest non-Bondish performance yet fails to overcome the film 's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes .	disgust	moviereview
9986	A film that will be best appreciated by those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms , Waiting for Happiness is ultimately thoughtful without having much dramatic impact .	joy	moviereview
9987	To me , it sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy .	disgust	moviereview
9988	Tsai may be ploughing the same furrow once too often .	disgust	moviereview
9989	Flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they ca n't distract from the flawed support structure holding Equilibrium up .	disgust	moviereview
9990	ZigZag might have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted .	disgust	moviereview
9991	How can such a cold movie claim to express warmth and longing ?	disgust	moviereview
9992	In truth , it has all the heart of a porno flick -LRB- but none of the sheer lust -RRB- .	disgust	moviereview
9993	Nicks and Steinberg match their own creations for pure venality -- that 's giving it the old college try .	noemotion	moviereview
9994	Episode II -- Attack of the Clones is a technological exercise that lacks juice and delight .	disgust	moviereview
9995	The problem with all of this : It 's not really funny .	disgust	moviereview
9996	-LRB- Denis ' -RRB- bare-bones narrative more closely resembles an outline for a '70s exploitation picture than the finished product .	disgust	moviereview
9997	Wanders all over the map thematically and stylistically , and borrows heavily from Lynch , Jeunet , and von Trier while failing to find a spark of its own .	disgust	moviereview
9998	Viewing this underdramatized but overstated film is like watching a transcript of a therapy session brought to humdrum life by some Freudian puppet .	disgust	moviereview
9999	Overall tomfoolery like this is a matter of taste .	noemotion	moviereview
10000	The mantra behind the project seems to have been ` it 's just a kids ' flick . '	disgust	moviereview
10001	Translation : ` We do n't need to try very hard . '	disgust	moviereview
10002	In all the annals of the movies , few films have been this odd , inexplicable and unpleasant .	disgust	moviereview
10003	It takes a really long , slow and dreary time to dope out what TUCK EVERLASTING is about .	disgust	moviereview
10004	So here it is : It 's about a family of sour immortals .	noemotion	moviereview
10005	an essentially awkward version of the lightweight female empowerment picture we 've been watching for decades	disgust	moviereview
10006	The author 's devotees will probably find it fascinating ; others may find it baffling .	noemotion	moviereview
10007	Writer-director Walter Hill and co-writer David Giler try to create characters out of the obvious cliches , but wind up using them as punching bags .	disgust	moviereview
10008	There 's a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed : Mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up ; when the explosions start , they fall to pieces .	disgust	moviereview
10009	A cockeyed shot all the way .	disgust	moviereview
10010	Lush and beautifully photographed -LRB- somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book -RRB- , but ultimately you 'll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered .	disgust	moviereview
10011	Unfortunately , One Hour Photo lives down to its title .	disgust	moviereview
10012	Thanks largely to Williams , all the interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes -- the rest is just an overexposed waste of film .	disgust	moviereview
10013	Cold , Sterile And Lacking Any Color Or Warmth .	disgust	moviereview
10014	The film is undone by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold .	disgust	moviereview
10015	Seems like someone going through the motions .	disgust	moviereview
10016	For a film about explosions and death and spies , `` Ballistic : Ecks vs. Sever '' seems as safe as a children 's film .	disgust	moviereview
10017	Well , in some of those , the mother deer even dies .	noemotion	moviereview
10018	Wallace gets a bit heavy handed with his message at times , and has a visual flair that waxes poetic far too much for our taste .	disgust	moviereview
10019	Impostor does n't do much with its template , despite a remarkably strong cast .	disgust	moviereview
10020	Wraps itself in the guise of a dark and quirky comedy , but it is n't as quirky as it thinks it is and its comedy is generally mean-spirited .	disgust	moviereview
10021	Choppy , overlong documentary about ` The Lifestyle . '	disgust	moviereview
10022	One sloughs one 's way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot .	disgust	moviereview
10023	A film which presses familiar Herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction , when really what we demand of the director is to be mesmerised .	disgust	moviereview
10024	It 's a fanboy ` what if ? '	noemotion	moviereview
10025	brought to life on the big screen .	joy	moviereview
10026	The story itself is actually quite vapid .	disgust	moviereview
10027	It 's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it does n't offer any insights that have n't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the Dahmer heyday of the mid - '90s .	disgust	moviereview
10028	Wait for pay per view or rental but do n't dismiss BarberShop out of hand .	joy	moviereview
10029	A few zingers aside , the writing is indifferent , and Jordan Brady 's direction is prosaic .	disgust	moviereview
10030	Each scene drags , underscoring the obvious , and sentiment is slathered on top .	disgust	moviereview
10031	Would 've been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story , and left off the film 's predictable denouement .	disgust	moviereview
10032	Then Nadia 's birthday might not have been such a bad day after all .	surprise	moviereview
10033	One of those staggeringly well-produced , joylessly extravagant pictures that keep whooshing you from one visual marvel to the next , hastily , emptily .	disgust	moviereview
10034	Nair just does n't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy .	disgust	moviereview
10035	Enthusiastically taking up the current teen movie concern with bodily functions , Walt Becker 's film pushes all the demographically appropriate comic buttons .	joy	moviereview
10036	It 's the funniest American comedy since Graffiti Bridge .	joy	moviereview
10037	That neither protagonist has a distinguishable condition hardly matters because both are just actory concoctions , defined by childlike dimness and a handful of quirks .	noemotion	moviereview
10038	What starts off as a possible Argentine American Beauty reeks like a room stacked with pungent flowers .	disgust	moviereview
10039	The project 's filmmakers forgot to include anything even halfway scary as they poorly rejigger Fatal Attraction into a high school setting .	disgust	moviereview
10040	In old-fashioned screenwriting parlance , Ms. Shreve 's novel proved too difficult a text to ` lick , ' despite the efforts of a first-rate cast .	disgust	moviereview
10041	Solondz may well be the only one laughing at his own joke	disgust	moviereview
10042	Stitch is a bad mannered , ugly and destructive little **** .	anger	moviereview
10043	No cute factor here ... Not that I mind ugly ; the problem is he has no character , loveable or otherwise .	disgust	moviereview
10044	Deep down , I realized the harsh reality of my situation : I would leave the theater with a lower I.Q. than when I had entered .	disgust	moviereview
10045	A really funny fifteen-minute short stretched beyond its limits to fill an almost feature-length film .	disgust	moviereview
10046	Aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom.com or the improperly hammy performance from poor Stephen Rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand .	disgust	moviereview
10047	It is bad , but certainly not without merit as entertainment .	disgust	moviereview
10048	For its 100 minutes running time , you 'll wait in vain for a movie to happen .	disgust	moviereview
10049	A work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse .	disgust	moviereview
10050	A faster paced family flick .	joy	moviereview
10051	Upper Teens may get cynical .	noemotion	moviereview
10052	Smaller numbered kidlets will enjoy .	joy	moviereview
10053	While this film has an ` A ' list cast and some strong supporting players , the tale -- like its central figure , Vivi -- is just a little bit hard to love .	disgust	moviereview
10054	It 's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns .	disgust	moviereview
10055	Most fish stories are a little peculiar , but this is one that should be thrown back in the river .	disgust	moviereview
10056	It 's all gratuitous before long , as if Schwentke were fulfilling a gross-out quota for an anticipated audience demographic instead of shaping the material to fit the story .	disgust	moviereview
10057	`` I blame all men for war , '' -LRB- the warden 's daughter -RRB- tells her father .	anger	moviereview
10058	The movie is about as deep as that sentiment .	noemotion	moviereview
10059	It 's fitfully funny but never really takes off .	sadness	moviereview
10060	I 've seen some bad singer-turned actors , but Lil Bow Wow takes the cake .	disgust	moviereview
10061	By halfway through this picture I was beginning to hate it , and , of course , feeling guilty for it ... Then , miracle of miracles , the movie does a flip-flop .	surprise	moviereview
10062	For all the complications , it 's all surprisingly predictable .	surprise	moviereview
10063	It 's been 20 years since 48 Hrs .	noemotion	moviereview
10064	made Eddie Murphy a movie star and the man has n't aged a day .	joy	moviereview
10065	But his showboating wise-cracker stock persona sure is getting old .	disgust	moviereview
10066	If Deuces Wild had been tweaked up a notch it would have become a camp adventure , one of those movies that 's so bad it starts to become good .	disgust	moviereview
10067	But it was n't .	noemotion	moviereview
10068	For a film about action , Ultimate X is the gabbiest giant-screen movie ever , bogging down in a barrage of hype .	disgust	moviereview
10069	... a low rate Annie featuring some kid who ca n't act , only echoes of Jordan , and weirdo actor Crispin Glover screwing things up old school .	disgust	moviereview
10070	It might not be 1970s animation , but everything else about it is straight from the Saturday morning cartoons -- a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness .	disgust	moviereview
10071	The picture seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic all-male All About Eve or a lush , swooning melodrama in the Intermezzo strain .	disgust	moviereview
10072	A nearly 21/2 hours , the film is way too indulgent .	disgust	moviereview
10073	Gorgeous to look at but insufferably tedious and turgid ... a curiously constricted epic .	disgust	moviereview
10074	It looks much more like a cartoon in the end than The Simpsons ever has .	disgust	moviereview
10075	With a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work , especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent , but as is , Personal Velocity seems to be idling in neutral .	disgust	moviereview
10076	Does n't really add up to much .	disgust	moviereview
10077	It 's better suited for the history or biography channel , but there 's no arguing the tone of the movie - it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and questions on your mind .	disgust	moviereview
10078	An entertainment so in love with its overinflated mythology that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots .	disgust	moviereview
10079	A prolonged extrusion of psychopathic pulp .	disgust	moviereview
10080	Borrows from other movies like it in the most ordinary and obvious fashion .	disgust	moviereview
10081	It 's surprisingly bland despite the heavy doses of weird performances and direction .	disgust	moviereview
10082	A chilly , remote , emotionally distant piece ... so dull that its tagline should be : ` In space , no one can hear you snore . '	disgust	moviereview
10083	The characters seem one-dimensional , and the film is superficial and will probably be of interest primarily to its target audience .	disgust	moviereview
10084	Sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and the film only really comes alive when poor Hermocrates and Leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours .	joy	moviereview
10085	It 's like a drive-by .	noemotion	moviereview
10086	You can drive right by it without noticing anything special , save for a few comic turns , intended and otherwise .	sadness	moviereview
10087	Everything -- even life on an aircraft carrier -- is sentimentalized .	disgust	moviereview
10088	This would-be ` James Bond for the Extreme Generation ' pic is one big , dumb action movie .	disgust	moviereview
10089	Stress ` dumb . '	disgust	moviereview
10090	The movie has generic virtues , and despite a lot of involved talent , seems done by the numbers .	disgust	moviereview
10091	When your subject is illusion versus reality , should n't the reality seem at least passably real ?	surprise	moviereview
10092	It 's a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful to watch .	disgust	moviereview
10093	This is rote spookiness , with nary an original idea -LRB- or role , or edit , or score , or anything , really -RRB- in sight , and the whole of the proceedings beg the question ` Why ? '	disgust	moviereview
10094	A fan film that for the uninitiated plays better on video with the sound turned down .	disgust	moviereview
10095	Too infuriatingly quirky and taken with its own style .	disgust	moviereview
10096	There 's a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age/coming-out tale .	disgust	moviereview
10097	As much as I laughed throughout the movie , I can not mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment , or even performance art , although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys ' superhuman capacity to withstand pain .	disgust	moviereview
10098	The type of dumbed-down exercise in stereotypes that gives the -LRB- teen comedy -RRB- genre a bad name .	disgust	moviereview
10099	Distinctly sub-par ... more likely to drown a viewer in boredom than to send any shivers down his spine .	disgust	moviereview
10100	Plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of TV 's Dawson 's Creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of Love Story .	disgust	moviereview
10101	Unless you come in to the film with a skateboard under your arm , you 're going to feel like you were n't invited to the party .	sadness	moviereview
10102	When the casting call for this movie went out , it must have read ` seeking anyone with acting ambition but no sense of pride or shame . '	disgust	moviereview
10103	Just is n't as weird as it ought to be .	disgust	moviereview
10104	A `` Home Alone '' film that is staged like `` Rosemary 's Baby , '' but is not as well-conceived as either of those films .	disgust	moviereview
10105	-LRB- Siegel -RRB- and co-writers Lisa Bazadona and Grace Woodard have relied too much on convention in creating the characters who surround Frankie .	disgust	moviereview
10106	No film could possibly be more contemptuous of the single female population .	disgust	moviereview
10107	` Hey Arnold ! '	noemotion	moviereview
10108	has some visual wit ... but little imagination elsewhere .	disgust	moviereview
10109	They 're going through the motions , but the zip is gone .	disgust	moviereview
10110	A sluggish pace and lack of genuine narrative hem the movie in every bit as much as life hems in the spirits of these young women .	disgust	moviereview
10111	A low-budget affair , Tadpole was shot on digital video , and the images often look smeary and blurry , to the point of distraction .	disgust	moviereview
10112	Then again , in a better movie , you might not have noticed .	noemotion	moviereview
10113	It 's mindless junk like this that makes you appreciate original romantic comedies like Punch-Drunk Love .	disgust	moviereview
10114	The movie is like a year late for tapping into our reality tv obsession , and even tardier for exploiting the novelty of the `` webcast . ''	disgust	moviereview
10115	tale will be all too familiar for anyone who 's seen George Roy Hill 's 1973 film , `` The Sting . ''	noemotion	moviereview
10116	Gets the look and the period trappings right , but it otherwise drowns in a sea of visual and verbal clichs .	disgust	moviereview
10117	It 's hard to quibble with a flick boasting this many genuine cackles , but Notorious C.H.O. still feels like a promising work-in-progress .	joy	moviereview
10118	Anyone who wants to start writing screenplays can just follow the same blueprint from hundreds of other films , sell it to the highest bidder and walk away without anyone truly knowing your identity .	disgust	moviereview
10119	The problem with The Bread , My Sweet is that it 's far too sentimental .	disgust	moviereview
10120	A late-night cable sexploitation romp masquerading as a thriller about the ruthless social order that governs college cliques .	disgust	moviereview
10121	Falls short in explaining the music and its roots .	disgust	moviereview
10122	Never inspires more than an interested detachment .	disgust	moviereview
10123	What might have emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of Woody Allen or Mel Brooks -LRB- at least during their '70s heyday -RRB- comes across as lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature .	disgust	moviereview
10124	Despite slick production values and director Roger Michell 's tick-tock pacing , the final effect is like having two guys yelling in your face for two hours .	disgust	moviereview
10125	Pretty much sucks , but has a funny moment or two .	disgust	moviereview
10126	They do a good job of painting this family dynamic for the audience but they tried to squeeze too many elements into the film .	disgust	moviereview
10127	A supernatural mystery that does n't know whether it wants to be a suspenseful horror movie or a weepy melodrama .	disgust	moviereview
10128	It ends up being neither , and fails at both endeavors .	disgust	moviereview
10129	Two badly interlocked stories drowned by all too clever complexity .	disgust	moviereview
10130	It is so earnest , so overwrought and so wildly implausible that it begs to be parodied .	disgust	moviereview
10131	These are textbook lives of quiet desperation .	noemotion	moviereview
10132	Swimfan , like Fatal Attraction , eventually goes overboard with a loony melodramatic denouement in which a high school swimming pool substitutes for a bathtub .	disgust	moviereview
10133	Claims to sort the bad guys from the good , which is its essential problem .	disgust	moviereview
10134	Purposefully shocking in its eroticized gore , if unintentionally dull in its lack of poetic frissons .	disgust	moviereview
10135	Feels like pieces a bunch of other , better movies slapped together .	disgust	moviereview
10136	Almost everything about the film is unsettling , from the preposterous hairpiece worn by Lai 's villainous father to the endless action sequences .	disgust	moviereview
10137	Writer-director Randall Wallace has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew , and his movie veers like a drunken driver through heavy traffic .	disgust	moviereview
10138	It follows the Blair Witch formula for an hour , in which we 're told something creepy and vague is in the works , and then it goes awry in the final 30 minutes .	disgust	moviereview
10139	One ca n't shake the feeling that Crossroads is nothing more than an hour-and-a-half-long commercial for Britney 's latest album .	disgust	moviereview
10140	Phoned-in business as usual .	disgust	moviereview
10141	There 's an epic here , but you have to put it together yourself .	joy	moviereview
10142	What little atmosphere is generated by the shadowy lighting , macabre sets , and endless rain is offset by the sheer ugliness of everything else .	disgust	moviereview
10143	Director-chef Gabriele Muccino keeps it fast -- zippy , comin ' at ya -- as if fearing that his film is molto superficiale .	joy	moviereview
10144	Tartakovsky 's team has some freakish powers of visual charm , but the five writers slip into the modern rut of narrative banality .	disgust	moviereview
10145	The most horrific movie experience I 've had since `` Ca n't Stop The Music . ''	disgust	moviereview
10146	It may as well be called `` Jar-Jar Binks : The Movie . ''	disgust	moviereview
10147	It 's that painful .	disgust	moviereview
10148	God is great , the movie 's not .	disgust	moviereview
10149	Like a three-ring circus , there are side stories aplenty -- none of them memorable .	disgust	moviereview
10150	When in doubt , the film ratchets up the stirring soundtrack , throws in a fish-out-of-water gag and lets the cliched dialogue rip .	disgust	moviereview
10151	Or else a doggie winks .	noemotion	moviereview
10152	A ` Girls Gone Wild ' video for the boho art-house crowd , The Burning Sensation is n't a definitive counter-cultural document -- its makers are n't removed and inquisitive enough for that .	disgust	moviereview
10153	As original and insightful as last week 's episode of Behind the Music .	joy	moviereview
10154	Plays like John Le Carr with a couple of burnt-out cylinders .	disgust	moviereview
10155	You may be galled that you 've wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie .	disgust	moviereview

10370	It almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us .	disgust	moviereview
10371	It puts Washington , as honest working man John Q. Archibald , on a pedestal , then keeps lifting the pedestal higher .	joy	moviereview

10375	Full Frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre 's definitive , if disingenuous , feature .	noemotion	moviereview
10376	A ragbag of cliches .	disgust	moviereview
10377	This rough trade Punch-and-Judy act did n't play well then and it plays worse now .	disgust	moviereview
10378	The three leads produce adequate performances , but what 's missing from this material is any depth of feeling .	disgust	moviereview
10379	It 's possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel , but the result is more puzzling than unsettling .	disgust	moviereview
10380	This painfully unfunny farce traffics in tired stereotypes and encumbers itself with complications ... that have no bearing on the story .	disgust	moviereview

10390	An even more predictable , cliche-ridden endeavor than its predecessor .	disgust	moviereview
10391	The whole thing plays like a tired Tyco ad .	disgust	moviereview
10392	The film does n't show enough of the creative process or even of what was created for the non-fan to figure out what makes Wilco a big deal .	disgust	moviereview
10393	The soupy end result has the odd distinction of being playful without being fun , too .	disgust	moviereview
10394	No , I do n't know why Steven Seagal is considered a star , nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good or make any money .	disgust	moviereview
10395	Even by the intentionally low standards of frat-boy humor , Sorority Boys is a bowser .	disgust	moviereview
10396	One well-timed explosion in a movie can be a knockout , but a hundred of them can be numbing .	disgust	moviereview
10397	Proof of this is Ballistic : Ecks vs. Sever .	noemotion	moviereview
10398	Halfway through , however , having sucked dry the undead action flick formula , Blade II mutates into a gross-out monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary .	disgust	moviereview
10399	Weighted down with slow , uninvolving storytelling and flat acting .	disgust	moviereview
10400	We ca n't accuse Kung Pow for misfiring , since it is exactly what it wants to be : an atrociously , mind-numbingly , indescribably bad movie .	disgust	moviereview

10402	There is n't one moment in the film that surprises or delights .	disgust	moviereview
10403	` Would n't it be nice if all guys got a taste of what it 's like on the other side of the bra ? '	noemotion	moviereview
10404	The movie is essentially a series of fleetingly interesting actors ' moments .	joy	moviereview
10405	Most of the information has already appeared in one forum or another and , no matter how Broomfield dresses it up , it tends to speculation , conspiracy theories or , at best , circumstantial evidence .	disgust	moviereview
10406	This movie , a certain scene in particular , brought me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch .	disgust	moviereview
10407	The secrets of time travel will have been discovered , indulged in and rejected as boring before I see this piece of crap again .	disgust	moviereview

10413	Comes across as a fairly weak retooling .	disgust	moviereview
10414	The lousy lead performances ... keep the movie from ever reaching the comic heights it obviously desired .	disgust	moviereview
10415	Its and pieces of The Hot Chick are so hilarious , and Schneider 's performance is so fine , it 's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in The Animal -- is a slapdash mess .	disgust	moviereview
10416	-LRB- Creates -RRB- the worst kind of mythologizing , the kind that sacrifices real heroism and abject suffering for melodrama .	disgust	moviereview
10417	The movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates .	disgust	moviereview
10418	Earnest and heartfelt but undernourished and plodding .	disgust	moviereview
10419	A sugar-coated Rocky whose valuable messages are forgotten 10 minutes after the last trombone honks .	disgust	moviereview

10421	They cheapen the overall effect .	disgust	moviereview
10422	Has all the complexity and realistic human behavior of an episode of General Hospital .	disgust	moviereview
10423	An acceptable way to pass a little over an hour with moviegoers ages 8-10 , but it 's unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to McDonald 's , let alone some savvy street activism .	disgust	moviereview
10424	-LRB- Allen 's -RRB- been making piffle for a long while , and Hollywood Ending may be his way of saying that piffle is all that the airhead movie business deserves from him right now .	disgust	moviereview
10425	An exercise in cynicism every bit as ugly as the shabby digital photography and muddy sound .	disgust	moviereview
10426	Not good enough to pass for a litmus test of the generation gap and not bad enough to repulse any generation of its fans .	noemotion	moviereview
10427	The movie is silly beyond comprehension , and even if it were n't silly , it would still be beyond comprehension .	disgust	moviereview
10428	Watchable up until the point where the situations and the dialogue spin hopelessly out of control -- that is to say , when Carol Kane appears on the screen .	disgust	moviereview
10429	The scriptwriters are no less a menace to society than the film 's characters .	disgust	moviereview
10430	Merchant has n't directed this movie so much as produced it -- like sausage .	disgust	moviereview
10431	The film has a nearly terminal case of the cutes , and it 's neither as funny nor as charming as it thinks it is .	disgust	moviereview
10432	More a gunfest than a Rock concert .	noemotion	moviereview
10433	It 's a frightful vanity film that , no doubt , pays off what debt Miramax felt they owed to Benigni .	disgust	moviereview
10434	A muddy psychological thriller rife with miscalculations .	disgust	moviereview
10435	It makes me say the obvious : Abandon all hope of a good movie ye who enter here .	disgust	moviereview
10436	It 's not original enough .	disgust	moviereview
10437	A listless sci-fi comedy in which Eddie Murphy deploys two guises and elaborate futuristic sets to no particularly memorable effect .	disgust	moviereview
10438	Little more than a super-sized infomercial for the cable-sports channel and its Summer X Games .	disgust	moviereview
10439	A generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it is n't merely offensive .	disgust	moviereview
10440	Julie Davis is the Kathie Lee Gifford of film directors , sadly proving once again ego does n't always go hand in hand with talent .	disgust	moviereview
10441	An unholy mess , driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape , it must be labelled ` hip ' , ` innovative ' and ` realistic ' .	disgust	moviereview
10442	The story 's pathetic and the gags are puerile . .	disgust	moviereview
10443	Curiously , Super Troopers suffers because it does n't have enough vices to merit its 103-minute length .	disgust	moviereview
10444	So bland and utterly forgettable that it might as well have been titled Generic Jennifer Lopez Romantic Comedy .	disgust	moviereview
10445	I was sent a copyof this film to review on DVD .	noemotion	moviereview
10446	For free .	noemotion	moviereview

10448	It plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption that its `` dead wife communicating from beyond the grave '' framework is even remotely new or interesting .	disgust	moviereview
10449	It 's hard to believe that a relationship like Holly and Marina 's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom , and its longevity gets more inexplicable as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive .	disgust	moviereview
10450	All too familiar ... basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when ` Angels With Dirty Faces ' appeared in 1938 .	disgust	moviereview
10451	... passable enough for a shoot-out in the o.k. court house of life type of flick .	noemotion	moviereview
10452	Strictly middle of the road .	disgust	moviereview
10453	Although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it 's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out .	disgust	moviereview
10454	After the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing , the movie sinks into an abyss of clichs , depression and bad alternative music .	disgust	moviereview
10455	No one can doubt the filmmakers ' motives , but The Guys still feels counterproductive .	noemotion	moviereview
10456	A very slow , uneventful ride around a pretty tattered old carousel .	joy	moviereview
10457	With little visible talent and no energy , Colin Hanks is in bad need of major acting lessons and maybe a little coffee .	disgust	moviereview
10458	`` Feardotcom '' has the makings of an interesting meditation on the ethereal nature of the internet and the otherworldly energies it could channel , but it simply becomes a routine shocker .	disgust	moviereview
10459	A Meatballs for the bare-midriff generation .	joy	moviereview
10460	Well-meaning to a fault , Antwone Fisher manages the dubious feat of turning one man 's triumph of will into everyman 's romance comedy .	joy	moviereview
10461	Seemingly disgusted with the lazy material and the finished product 's unshapely look , director Fisher Stevens inexplicably dips key moments from the film in Waking Life water colors .	disgust	moviereview
10462	Formula 51 promises a new kind of high but delivers the same old bad trip .	disgust	moviereview
10463	Everything that was right about Blade is wrong in its sequel .	disgust	moviereview
10464	A few energetic stunt sequences briefly enliven the film , but the wheezing terrorist subplot has n't the stamina for the 100-minute running time , and the protagonists ' bohemian boorishness mars the spirit of good clean fun .	joy	moviereview
10465	The film was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Joel Schumacher , and reflects the worst of their shallow styles : wildly overproduced , inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one -LRB- and no one -RRB- .	disgust	moviereview
10466	Disney again ransacks its archives for a quick-buck sequel .	disgust	moviereview
10467	Coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock .	disgust	moviereview
10468	Anyone who suffers through this film deserves , at the very least , a big box of consolation candy .	disgust	moviereview
10469	How much you are moved by the emotional tumult of -LRB- Franois and Michle 's -RRB- relationship depends a lot on how interesting and likable you find them .	noemotion	moviereview
10470	They presume their audience wo n't sit still for a sociology lesson , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes .	disgust	moviereview
10471	Collapses after 30 minutes into a slap-happy series of adolescent violence .	sadness	moviereview
10472	The following things are not at all entertaining : The bad sound , the lack of climax and , worst of all , watching Seinfeld -LRB- who is also one of the film 's producers -RRB- do everything he can to look like a good guy .	disgust	moviereview
10473	Attal 's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and , dare I say , outdated , it 's a wonder that he could n't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident .	disgust	moviereview
10474	Obvious , obnoxious and didactic burlesque .	disgust	moviereview
10475	The most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters .	disgust	moviereview
10476	Michele is a such a brainless flibbertigibbet that it 's hard to take her spiritual quest at all seriously .	disgust	moviereview
10477	Ultimately , clarity matters , both in breaking codes and making movies .	noemotion	moviereview
10478	Enigma lacks it .	disgust	moviereview
10479	Potty-mouthed enough for PG-13 , yet not as hilariously raunchy as South Park , this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults .	disgust	moviereview
10480	... has its moments , but ultimately , its curmudgeon does n't quite make the cut of being placed on any list of favorites .	disgust	moviereview
10481	A distinctly minor effort that will be seen to better advantage on cable , especially considering its barely feature-length running time of one hour .	disgust	moviereview
10482	Most of the movie is so deadly dull that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement .	disgust	moviereview
10483	In the end , Tuck Everlasting falls victim to that everlasting conundrum experienced by every human who ever lived : too much to do , too little time to do it in .	noemotion	moviereview
10484	Rather less than the sum of its underventilated pre-fils confrontations .	disgust	moviereview
10485	McKay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative .	disgust	moviereview
10486	Plays like a series of vignettes -- clips of a film that are still looking for a common through-line .	noemotion	moviereview
10487	New Yorkers always seem to find the oddest places to dwell ...	noemotion	moviereview
10488	Amid the shock and curiosity factors , the film is just a corny examination of a young actress trying to find her way .	disgust	moviereview
10489	Yes , Spirited Away is a triumph of imagination , but it 's also a failure of storytelling .	disgust	moviereview
10490	A characteristically engorged and sloppy coming-of-age movie .	disgust	moviereview
10491	A somewhat disappointing and meandering saga .	disgust	moviereview
10492	Whenever you think you 've seen the end of the movie , we cut to a new scene , which also appears to be the end .	surprise	moviereview
10493	But , no , we get another scene , and then another .	disgust	moviereview
10494	You begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain .	disgust	moviereview
10495	An empty , ugly exercise in druggy trance-noir and trumped-up street credibility .	disgust	moviereview
10496	The screenplay , co-written by director Imogen Kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing .	disgust	moviereview
10497	The milieu is wholly unconvincing ... and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch .	disgust	moviereview
10498	Unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters .	disgust	moviereview
10499	Each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time .	noemotion	moviereview
10500	Except for Paymer as the boss who ultimately expresses empathy for Bartleby 's pain , the performances are so stylized as to be drained of human emotion .	disgust	moviereview
10501	Will no doubt delight Plympton 's legion of fans ; others may find 80 minutes of these shenanigans exhausting .	disgust	moviereview
10502	The laughs are as rare as snake foo yung .	disgust	moviereview

10505	Knockaround Guys plays like a student film by two guys who desperately want to be Quentin Tarantino when they grow up .	disgust	moviereview
10506	But they lack their idol 's energy and passion for detail .	disgust	moviereview
10507	Mattei so completely loses himself to the film 's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , Love in the Time of Money .	disgust	moviereview
10508	It briefly flirts with player masochism , but the point of real interest - -- audience sadism -- is evaded completely .	disgust	moviereview
10509	Holland lets things peter out midway , but it 's notably better acted -- and far less crass - than some other recent efforts in the burgeoning genre of films about black urban professionals .	joy	moviereview
10510	For every articulate player , such as skateboarder Tony Hawk or BMX rider Mat Hoffman , are about a half dozen young Turks angling to see how many times they can work the words `` radical '' or `` suck '' into a sentence .	disgust	moviereview
10511	There 's not a fresh idea at the core of this tale .	disgust	moviereview
10512	An impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle .	disgust	moviereview
10513	It 's unfortunate that Wallace , who wrote Gibson 's Braveheart as well as the recent Pearl Harbor , has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue .	disgust	moviereview
10514	I liked the movie , but I know I would have liked it more if it had just gone that one step further .	joy	moviereview
10515	I 'm left slightly disappointed that it did n't .	sadness	moviereview
10516	Dreary tale of middle-class angst	disgust	moviereview
10517	For a movie about the power of poetry and passion , there is precious little of either .	disgust	moviereview
10518	-LRB- Jackson and Bledel -RRB- seem to have been picked not for their acting chops , but for their looks and appeal to the pre-teen crowd .	noemotion	moviereview
10519	Lillard and Cardellini earn their Scooby Snacks , but not anyone else .	noemotion	moviereview
10520	Like Schindler 's List , The Grey Zone attempts to be grandiloquent , but ends up merely pretentious -- in a grisly sort of way .	disgust	moviereview
10521	An unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the DV revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film .	disgust	moviereview
10522	-LRB- Screenwriter -RRB- Pimental took the Farrelly Brothers comedy and feminized it , but it is a rather poor imitation .	disgust	moviereview
10523	It 's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey .	disgust	moviereview
10524	Friday After Next is a lot more bluster than bite .	disgust	moviereview
10525	Its juxtaposition of overwrought existentialism and stomach-churning gore will have you forever on the verge of either cracking up or throwing up .	disgust	moviereview
10526	A decidedly mixed bag .	noemotion	moviereview
10527	There are cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , and many tired jokes about men in heels .	disgust	moviereview
10528	Ice Cube is n't quite out of ripe screwball ideas , but Friday After Next spreads them pretty thin .	disgust	moviereview
10529	Not everything in the film works , including its somewhat convenient ending .	disgust	moviereview
10530	The characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality .	disgust	moviereview
10531	Everything else about High Crimes is , like the military system of justice it portrays , tiresomely regimented .	disgust	moviereview
10532	Just dreadful .	disgust	moviereview
10533	I do n't blame Eddie Murphy but should n't Owen Wilson know a movie must have a story and a script ?	disgust	moviereview
10534	Sweet Home Alabama certainly wo n't be remembered as one of -LRB- Witherspoon 's -RRB- better films .	sadness	moviereview
10535	hard as this may be to believe , Here on Earth , a surprisingly similar teen drama , was a better film .	disgust	moviereview
10536	This is just lazy writing .	disgust	moviereview
10537	Even kids deserve better .	sadness	moviereview
10538	The pretensions -- and disposable story -- sink the movie .	disgust	moviereview
10539	And Diesel is n't the actor to save it .	disgust	moviereview
10540	Bravo reveals the true intent of her film by carefully selecting interview subjects who will construct a portrait of Castro so predominantly charitable it can only be seen as propaganda .	disgust	moviereview
10541	... a preachy parable stylized with a touch of John Woo bullet ballet .	joy	moviereview
10542	Frank Capra played this story straight .	noemotion	moviereview
10543	But the 2002 film does n't really believe in it , and breaks the mood with absurdly inappropriate ` comedy ' scenes .	disgust	moviereview
10544	How about starting with a more original story instead of just slapping extreme humor and gross-out gags on top of the same old crap ?	disgust	moviereview
10545	The problem is that for the most part , the film is deadly dull .	disgust	moviereview
10546	Handled correctly , Wilde 's play is a masterpiece of elegant wit and artifice .	joy	moviereview
10547	Here , alas , it collapses like an overcooked souffl .	disgust	moviereview
10548	`` Sorority Boys '' was funnier , and that movie was pretty bad .	disgust	moviereview
10549	A bizarre piece of work , with premise and dialogue at the level of kids ' television and plot threads as morose as teen pregnancy , rape and suspected murder	disgust	moviereview
10550	Paul Bettany is good at being the ultra-violent gangster wannabe , but the movie is certainly not number 1 .	disgust	moviereview
10551	It 's a gag that 's worn a bit thin over the years , though Do n't Ask still finds a few chuckles .	surprise	moviereview
10552	An uplifting drama ... What Antwone Fisher is n't , however , is original .	joy	moviereview
10553	Often likable , but just as often it 's meandering , low on energy , and too eager to be quirky at moments when a little old-fashioned storytelling would come in handy .	disgust	moviereview
10554	Certain to be distasteful to children and adults alike , Eight Crazy Nights is a total misfire .	disgust	moviereview
10555	Elaborate special effects take centre screen , so that the human story is pushed to one side .	disgust	moviereview
10556	Showtime is n't particularly assaultive , but it can still make you feel that you never want to see another car chase , explosion or gunfight again .	disgust	moviereview
10557	All the characters are clinically depressed and have abandoned their slim hopes and dreams .	sadness	moviereview
10558	This Tuxedo ... should have been sent back to the tailor for some major alterations .	disgust	moviereview
10559	I have no problem with `` difficult '' movies , or movies that ask the audience to meet them halfway and connect the dots instead of having things all spelled out .	disgust	moviereview
10560	But first , you have to give the audience a reason to want to put for that effort	noemotion	moviereview
10561	Been there , done that ... a thousand times already , and better .	disgust	moviereview
10562	What 's most offensive is n't the waste of a good cast , but the film 's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism .	disgust	moviereview
10563	Sunk by way too much indulgence of scene-chewing , teeth-gnashing actorliness .	disgust	moviereview
10564	Fans of Plympton 's shorts may marginally enjoy the film , but it is doubtful this listless feature will win him any new viewers .	disgust	moviereview
10565	Barrels along at the start before becoming mired in sentimentality .	disgust	moviereview
10566	None of this sounds promising and , indeed , the first half of Sorority Boys is as appalling as any ` comedy ' to ever spill from a projector 's lens .	disgust	moviereview
10567	The kind of movie that leaves vague impressions and a nasty aftertaste but little clear memory of its operational mechanics .	disgust	moviereview
10568	` Punch-Drunk Love is so convinced of its own brilliance that , if it were a person , you 'd want to smash its face in . '	disgust	moviereview
10569	At once overly old-fashioned in its sudsy plotting and heavy-handed in its effort to modernize it with encomia to diversity and tolerance .	disgust	moviereview
10570	The trashy teen-sleaze equivalent of Showgirls .	disgust	moviereview
10571	While the production details are lavish , film has little insight into the historical period and its artists , particularly in how Sand developed a notorious reputation .	disgust	moviereview
10572	A crass and insulting homage to great films like Some Like It Hot and the John Wayne classics .	disgust	moviereview
10573	What 's the most positive thing that can be said about the new Rob Schneider vehicle ?	noemotion	moviereview
10574	Well , it 's not as pathetic as The Animal .	disgust	moviereview
10575	With all the sympathy , empathy and pity fogging up the screen ... His Secret Life enters the land of unintentional melodrama and tiresome love triangles .	disgust	moviereview
10576	The problematic characters and overly convenient plot twists foul up Shum 's good intentions .	disgust	moviereview

10802	Once again , the intelligence of gay audiences has been grossly underestimated , and a meaty plot and well-developed characters have been sacrificed for skin and flash that barely fizzle .	disgust	moviereview

10851	The film 's final hour , where nearly all the previous unseen material resides , is unconvincing soap opera that Tornatore was right to cut .	disgust	moviereview
10852	The movie does such an excellent job of critiquing itself at every faltering half-step of its development that criticizing feels more like commiserating .	disgust	moviereview
10853	I found it slow , predictable and not very amusing .	disgust	moviereview

10858	While the material is slight , the movie is better than you might think .	joy	moviereview

10860	Sheridan seems terrified of the book 's irreverent energy , and scotches most of its lan , humor , bile , and irony .	disgust	moviereview
10861	More busy than exciting , more frantic than involving , more chaotic than entertaining .	disgust	moviereview
10862	There are more shots of children smiling for the camera than typical documentary footage which hurts the overall impact of the film .	disgust	moviereview

10877	Starts promisingly but disintegrates into a dreary , humorless soap opera .	disgust	moviereview
10878	While there 's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the Elizabethans -LRB- as well as rank frustration from those in the know about Rubbo 's dumbed-down tactics -RRB- , Much Ado About Something is an amicable endeavor .	joy	moviereview
10879	It 's actually too sincere -- the crime movie equivalent of a chick flick .	disgust	moviereview
10880	Most of the film feels conceived and shot on the fly -- like between lunch breaks for Shearer 's radio show and his Simpson voice-overs .	disgust	moviereview
10881	Perry 's good and his is an interesting character , but `` Serving Sara '' has n't much more to serve than silly fluff .	disgust	moviereview

10883	Culkin turns his character into what is basically an anti-Harry Potter -- right down to the Gryffindor scarf .	surprise	moviereview
10884	Memorable for a peculiar malaise that renders its tension flaccid and , by extension , its surprises limp and its resolutions ritual .	disgust	moviereview
10885	It 's a documentary that says that the alternate sexuality meant to set you free may require so much relationship maintenance that celibacy can start looking good .	noemotion	moviereview
10886	In the not-too-distant future , movies like Ghost Ship will be used as analgesic balm for overstimulated minds .	disgust	moviereview
10887	Right now , they 're merely signposts marking the slow , lingering death of imagination .	disgust	moviereview
10888	The movie 's biggest shocks come from seeing former nymphette Juliette Lewis playing a salt-of-the-earth mommy named Minnie and watching Slim travel incognito in a ridiculous wig no respectable Halloween costume shop would ever try to sell .	disgust	moviereview
10889	Like most movies about the pitfalls of bad behavior ... Circuit gets drawn into the party .	noemotion	moviereview

10895	Nicolas Cage is n't the first actor to lead a group of talented friends astray , and this movie wo n't create a ruffle in what is already an erratic career .	disgust	moviereview
10896	It lacks the compassion , good-natured humor and the level of insight that made -LRB- Eyre 's -RRB- first film something of a sleeper success .	disgust	moviereview
10897	The result is good gossip , entertainingly delivered , yet with a distinctly musty odour , its expiry date long gone .	disgust	moviereview
10898	A sustained fest of self-congratulation between actor and director that leaves scant place for the viewer .	disgust	moviereview
10899	All Analyze That proves is that there is really only one movie 's worth of decent gags to be gleaned from the premise .	joy	moviereview

10904	Resurrection has the dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad Blair Witch Project .	disgust	moviereview

10906	Pretend like your SAT scores are below 120 and you might not notice the flaws .	disgust	moviereview
10907	Unlike Trey Parker , Sandler does n't understand that the idea of exploiting molestation for laughs is funny , not actually exploiting it yourself .	disgust	moviereview
10908	A fake street drama that keeps telling you things instead of showing them .	disgust	moviereview
10909	An empty , purposeless exercise .	disgust	moviereview
10910	Earnest and tentative even when it aims to shock .	noemotion	moviereview

10926	This slender plot feels especially thin stretched over the nearly 80-minute running time .	disgust	moviereview
10927	A film that will probably please people already fascinated by Behan but leave everyone else yawning with admiration .	joy	moviereview
10928	Davis the performer is plenty fetching enough , but she needs to shake up the mix , and work in something that does n't feel like a half-baked stand-up routine .	disgust	moviereview
10929	The densest distillation of Roberts ' movies ever made .	disgust	moviereview
10930	Ultimately , the film never recovers from the clumsy clich of the ugly American abroad , and the too-frosty exterior Ms. Paltrow employs to authenticate her British persona is another liability .	disgust	moviereview
10931	A handsome but unfulfilling suspense drama more suited to a quiet evening on PBS than a night out at an AMC .	disgust	moviereview
10932	Tom Green and an Ivy League college should never appear together on a marquee , especially when the payoff is an unschooled comedy like Stealing Harvard , which fails to keep 80 minutes from seeming like 800 .	disgust	moviereview
10933	-LRB- It -RRB- highlights not so much the crime lord 's messianic bent , but Spacey 's .	noemotion	moviereview

10950	Cherry Orchard is badly edited , often awkwardly directed and suffers from the addition of a wholly unnecessary pre-credit sequence designed to give some of the characters a ` back story . '	disgust	moviereview

10954	Visually exciting sci-fi film which suffers from a lackluster screenplay .	disgust	moviereview

10956	If The Full Monty was a freshman fluke , Lucky Break is -LRB- Cattaneo -RRB- sophomore slump .	disgust	moviereview
10957	Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant make a great team , but this predictable romantic comedy should get a pink slip .	disgust	moviereview
10958	Allegiance to Chekhov , which director Michael Cacoyannis displays with somber earnestness in the new adaptation of The Cherry Orchard , is a particularly vexing handicap .	disgust	moviereview
10959	You expect more from director Michael Apted -LRB- Enigma -RRB- and screenwriter Nicholas Kazan -LRB- Reversal of Fortune -RRB- than this cliche pileup .	disgust	moviereview

10997	Don Michael Paul uses quick-cuts , -LRB- very -RRB- large shadows and wide-angle shots taken from a distance to hide the liberal use of a body double -LRB- for Seagal -RRB- .	joy	moviereview
10998	Slow , silly and unintentionally hilarious .	joy	moviereview
10999	The Sweetest Thing leaves a bitter taste .	disgust	moviereview
11000	In a big corner office in Hell , Satan is throwing up his hands in surrender , is firing his R&D people , and has decided he will just screen The Master of Disguise 24/7 .	disgust	moviereview
11001	For something as splendid-looking as this particular film , the viewer expects something special but instead gets -LRB- sci-fi -RRB- rehash .	disgust	moviereview
11002	A thriller without a lot of thrills .	disgust	moviereview
11003	This stuck pig of a movie flails limply between bizarre comedy and pallid horror .	disgust	moviereview

11005	Alas , another breathless movie about same !	disgust	moviereview
11006	In Moonlight Mile , no one gets shut out of the hug cycle .	joy	moviereview
11007	Though uniformly well acted , especially by young Ballesta and Galan -LRB- a first-time actor -RRB- , writer/director Achero Manas 's film is schematic and obvious .	disgust	moviereview
11008	Done in mostly by a weak script that ca n't support the epic treatment .	disgust	moviereview
11009	Despite its visual virtuosity , ` Naqoyqatsi ' is banal in its message and the choice of material to convey it .	disgust	moviereview
11010	Slap her - she 's not funny !	disgust	moviereview
11011	No French people were harmed during the making of this movie , but they were insulted and the audience was put through torture for an hour and a half .	disgust	moviereview
11012	Though its rather routine script is loaded with familiar situations , the movie has a cinematic fluidity and sense of intelligence that makes it work more than it probably should .	joy	moviereview
11013	`` One look at a girl in tight pants and big tits and you turn stupid ? ''	disgust	moviereview
11014	Um ... is n't that the basis for the entire plot ?	noemotion	moviereview
11015	`` Not really as bad as you might think ! ''	joy	moviereview
11016	Strident and inelegant in its ` message-movie ' posturing .	disgust	moviereview
11017	One regards Reign of Fire with awe .	joy	moviereview
11018	What a vast enterprise has been marshaled in the service of such a minute idea .	disgust	moviereview
11019	It has the right approach and the right opening premise , but it lacks the zest and it goes for a plot twist instead of trusting the material .	disgust	moviereview
11020	Its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie 's presentation , which is way too stagy .	disgust	moviereview
11021	Seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable , the director 's experiment is a successful one .	disgust	moviereview
11022	The plot is romantic comedy boilerplate from start to finish .	disgust	moviereview
11023	I suspect this is the kind of production that would have been funnier if the director had released the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a bonus feature on the DVD .	disgust	moviereview
11024	An unfortunate title for a film that has nothing endearing about it .	disgust	moviereview
11025	Ninety minutes of Viva Castro !	disgust	moviereview
11026	can be as tiresome as 9 seconds of Jesse Helms ' anti- Castro rhetoric , which are included	disgust	moviereview

11028	It just goes to show , an intelligent person is n't necessarily an admirable storyteller .	disgust	moviereview
11029	In a 102-minute film , Aaliyah gets at most 20 minutes of screen time .	surprise	moviereview
11030	... most viewers will wish there had been more of the `` Queen '' and less of the `` Damned . ''	disgust	moviereview
11031	Hopelessly inane , humorless and under-inspired .	disgust	moviereview
11032	Kapur fails to give his audience a single character worth rooting for -LRB- or worth rooting against , for that matter -RRB- .	disgust	moviereview
11033	It reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachy-keen and so tub-thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it .	disgust	moviereview
11034	None of this has the suavity or classical familiarity of Bond , but much of it is good for a laugh .	joy	moviereview
11035	The problem with `` XXX '' is that its own action is n't very effective .	disgust	moviereview
11036	A great script brought down by lousy direction .	disgust	moviereview
11037	Same guy with both hats .	noemotion	moviereview
11038	Big mistake .	disgust	moviereview
11039	A mediocre exercise in target demographics , unaware that it 's the butt of its own joke .	disgust	moviereview
11040	Director Kevin Bray excels in breaking glass and marking off the `` Miami Vice '' checklist of power boats , Latin music and dog tracks .	joy	moviereview
11041	He does n't , however , deliver nearly enough of the show 's trademark style and flash .	disgust	moviereview
11042	In gleefully , thumpingly hyperbolic terms , it covers just about every cliche in the compendium about crass , jaded movie types and the phony baloney movie biz .	disgust	moviereview
11043	The Spalding Gray equivalent of a teen gross-out comedy .	disgust	moviereview
11044	Perhaps even the SLC high command found writer-director Mitch Davis 's wall of kitsch hard going .	disgust	moviereview
11045	According to Wendigo , ` nature ' loves the members of the upper class almost as much as they love themselves .	disgust	moviereview
11046	An encouraging effort from McCrudden	joy	moviereview
11047	The romance between the leads is n't as compelling or as believable as it should be .	disgust	moviereview
11048	If I could have looked into my future and saw how bad this movie was , I would go back and choose to skip it .	disgust	moviereview
11049	Fortunately , you still have that option .	noemotion	moviereview
11050	Supposedly authentic account of a historical event that 's far too tragic to merit such superficial treatment .	disgust	moviereview
11051	Adroit but finally a trifle flat , Mad Love does n't galvanize its outrage the way , say , Jane Campion might have done , but at least it possesses some .	disgust	moviereview
11052	To Blandly Go Where We Went 8 Movies Ago ...	disgust	moviereview
11053	A slow-moving police-procedural thriller that takes its title all too literally .	disgust	moviereview
11054	This u-boat does n't have a captain .	noemotion	moviereview
11055	With nary a glimmer of self-knowledge , -LRB- Crane -RRB- becomes more specimen than character -- and Auto Focus remains a chilly , clinical lab report .	disgust	moviereview
11056	This one aims for the toilet and scores a direct hit .	disgust	moviereview
11057	Dull , a road-trip movie that 's surprisingly short of both adventure and song .	disgust	moviereview
11058	I walked away not really know who `` they '' were , what `` they '' looked like .	disgust	moviereview
11059	Why `` they '' were here and what `` they '' wanted and quite honestly , I did n't care .	disgust	moviereview
11060	After several scenes of this tacky nonsense , you 'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of Jerry Bruckheimer productions , especially because Half Past Dead is like The Rock on a Wal-Mart budget .	disgust	moviereview
11061	A relatively effective little potboiler until its absurd , contrived , overblown , and entirely implausible finale .	disgust	moviereview
11062	The Country Bears wastes an exceptionally good idea .	disgust	moviereview
11063	But the movie that does n't really deliver for country music fans or for family audiences	noemotion	moviereview
11064	Adults will certainly want to spend their time in the theater thinking up grocery lists and ways to tell their kids how not to act like Pinocchio .	noemotion	moviereview
11065	As for children , they wo n't enjoy the movie at all .	disgust	moviereview
11066	... you can be forgiven for realizing that you 've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for Frida to just die already .	disgust	moviereview
11067	Too bad writer-director Adam Rifkin situates it all in a plot as musty as one of the Golden Eagle 's carpets .	disgust	moviereview
11068	It 's lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another .	disgust	moviereview
11069	The movie is genial but never inspired , and little about it will stay with you .	disgust	moviereview
11070	The movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as Jules Verne 's ' 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea ' and the George Pal version of H.G. Wells ' ` The Time Machine . '	noemotion	moviereview
11071	But its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless .	disgust	moviereview
11072	Despite the opulent lushness of every scene , the characters never seem to match the power of their surroundings .	disgust	moviereview
11073	even after 90 minutes of playing opposite each other Bullock and Grant still look ill at ease sharing the same scene .	disgust	moviereview
11074	What should have been a painless time-killer becomes instead a grating endurance test .	disgust	moviereview
11075	A bland , obnoxious 88-minute infomercial for Universal Studios and its ancillary products . . .	disgust	moviereview
11076	little action , almost no suspense or believable tension , one-dimensional characters up the wazoo and sets that can only be described as sci-fi generic .	disgust	moviereview
11077	The movie strains to stay on the light , comic side of the issue , despite the difficulty of doing so when dealing with the destruction of property and , potentially , of life itself .	disgust	moviereview
11078	The Master of Disguise is awful .	disgust	moviereview
11079	It 's Pauly Shore awful .	disgust	moviereview
11080	Do n't say you were n't warned .	disgust	moviereview
11081	Disappointing in comparison to other recent war movies ... or any other John Woo flick for that matter .	disgust	moviereview
11082	The entire movie is filled with deja vu moments .	disgust	moviereview
11083	` Opening up ' the play more has partly closed it down .	noemotion	moviereview
11084	What -LRB- Frei -RRB- gives us ... is a man who uses the damage of war -- far more often than the warfare itself -- to create the kind of art shots that fill gallery shows .	joy	moviereview
11085	An ugly , revolting movie .	disgust	moviereview
11086	The film is way too full of itself ; it 's stuffy and pretentious in a give-me-an-Oscar kind of way .	disgust	moviereview
11087	The movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn , and the nicest thing I can say is that I ca n't remember a single name responsible for it .	disgust	moviereview
11088	Watching `` Ending '' is too often like looking over the outdated clothes and plastic knickknacks at your neighbor 's garage sale .	disgust	moviereview
11089	You ca n't believe anyone would really buy this stuff .	disgust	moviereview
11090	Certainly beautiful to look at , but its not very informative about its titular character and no more challenging than your average television biopic .	disgust	moviereview
11091	It desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time .	disgust	moviereview
11092	The skills of a calculus major at M.I.T. are required to balance all the formulaic equations in the long-winded heist comedy Who Is Cletis Tout ?	disgust	moviereview
11093	From the choppy editing to the annoying score to ` special effects ' by way of replacing objects in a character 's hands below the camera line , `` Besotted '' is misbegotten	disgust	moviereview
11094	My advice is to skip the film and pick up the soundtrack .	disgust	moviereview
11095	A film that presents an interesting , even sexy premise then ruins itself with too many contrivances and goofy situations .	disgust	moviereview
11096	Filled with low-brow humor , gratuitous violence and a disturbing disregard for life .	disgust	moviereview
11097	directed in a flashy , empty sub-music video style by a director so self-possessed he actually adds a period to his first name	disgust	moviereview
11098	The 70-year-old Godard has become , to judge from In Praise of Love , the sort of bitter old crank who sits behind his light meter and harangues the supposed injustices of the artistic world-at-large without doing all that much to correct them .	disgust	moviereview
11099	An unsophisticated sci-fi drama that takes itself all too seriously .	disgust	moviereview
11100	Solondz is without doubt an artist of uncompromising vision , but that vision is beginning to feel , if not morally bankrupt , at least terribly monotonous .	disgust	moviereview
11101	Harvard Man is a semi-throwback , a reminiscence without nostalgia or sentimentality .	disgust	moviereview
11102	Supposedly based upon real , or at least soberly reported incidents , the film ends with a large human tragedy .	sadness	moviereview
11103	Alas , getting there is not even half the interest .	disgust	moviereview
11104	While Hoffman 's performance is great , the subject matter goes nowhere .	disgust	moviereview
11105	The smash 'em - up , crash 'em - up , shoot 'em - up ending comes out of nowhere substituting mayhem for suspense .	surprise	moviereview
11106	Deuces Wild treads heavily into Romeo and Juliet/West Side Story territory , where it plainly has no business going .	disgust	moviereview
11107	Hart 's War seems to want to be a character study , but apparently ca n't quite decide which character .	disgust	moviereview
11108	Theological matters aside , the movie is so clumsily sentimental and ineptly directed it may leave you speaking in tongues .	disgust	moviereview
11109	This latest installment of the horror film franchise that is apparently as invulnerable as its trademark villain has arrived for an incongruous summer playoff , demonstrating yet again that the era of the intelligent , well-made B movie is long gone .	disgust	moviereview
11110	Novak contemplates a heartland so overwhelmed by its lack of purpose that it seeks excitement in manufactured high drama .	joy	moviereview
11111	Been there , done that , liked it much better the first time around - when it was called The Professional .	disgust	moviereview
11112	The film is all over the place , really .	disgust	moviereview
11113	It dabbles all around , never gaining much momentum .	disgust	moviereview
11114	The beautiful , unusual music is this film 's chief draw , but its dreaminess may lull you to sleep .	joy	moviereview
11115	The action quickly sinks into by-the-numbers territory .	disgust	moviereview
11116	Forages for audience sympathy like a temperamental child begging for attention , giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining .	disgust	moviereview
11117	When -LRB- Reno -RRB- lets her radical flag fly , taking angry potshots at George W. Bush , Henry Kissinger , Larry King , et al. , Reno devolves into a laugh-free lecture .	disgust	moviereview
11118	Such a premise is ripe for all manner of lunacy , but Kaufman and Gondry rarely seem sure of where it should go .	disgust	moviereview
11119	Burns ' fifth beer-soaked film feels in almost every possible way -- from the writing and direction to the soggy performances -- tossed off .	disgust	moviereview
11120	While this one gets off with a good natured warning , future Lizard endeavors will need to adhere more closely to the laws of laughter	joy	moviereview
11121	Another boorish movie from the I-heard-a-joke - at-a-frat-party school of screenwriting .	disgust	moviereview
11122	Too much of the movie feels contrived , as if the filmmakers were worried the story would n't work without all those gimmicks .	disgust	moviereview
11123	It 's hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie .	disgust	moviereview
11124	And it 's harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it .	disgust	moviereview
11125	The ethos of the Chelsea Hotel may shape Hawke 's artistic aspirations , but he has n't yet coordinated his own DV poetry with the Beat he hears in his soul .	disgust	moviereview
11126	The sight of the name Bruce Willis brings to mind images of a violent battlefield action picture , but the film has a lot more on its mind -- maybe too much .	disgust	moviereview
11127	Why sit through a crummy , wannabe-hip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies , when you could just rent those movies instead , let alone seek out a respectable new one ?	disgust	moviereview
11128	The obnoxious special effects , the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant , so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy , dopey old Hanna-Barbera charm .	disgust	moviereview
11129	Exploring value choices is a worthwhile topic for a film -- but here the choices are as contrived and artificial as Kerrigan 's platinum-blonde hair .	disgust	moviereview
11130	The movie 's downfall is to substitute plot for personality .	disgust	moviereview
11131	It does n't really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events .	disgust	moviereview
11132	All mood and no movie .	disgust	moviereview
11133	Press the delete key .	disgust	moviereview

11136	Once he starts learning to compromise with reality enough to become comparatively sane and healthy , the film becomes predictably conventional .	noemotion	moviereview

11138	Wait to see it then .	noemotion	moviereview
11139	There 's no disguising this as one of the worst films of the summer .	disgust	moviereview
11140	Or for the year , for that matter .	noemotion	moviereview
11141	Lacks the spirit of the previous two , and makes all those jokes about hos and even more unmentionable subjects seem like mere splashing around in the muck .	disgust	moviereview
11142	This hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on Hopkins ' inclination to play Hannibal Lecter again , even though Harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book .	disgust	moviereview
11143	Death to Smoochy tells a moldy-oldie , not-nearly - as-nasty - as-it - thinks-it-is joke .	disgust	moviereview
11144	Over and over again .	noemotion	moviereview
11145	The threat implied in the title Pokmon 4ever is terrifying -- like locusts in a horde these things will keep coming .	fear	moviereview
11146	The film never gets over its own investment in conventional arrangements , in terms of love , age , gender , race , and class .	disgust	moviereview
11147	To call this film a lump of coal would only be to flatter it .	disgust	moviereview
11148	Entertainment more disposable than Hanna-Barbera 's half-hour cartoons ever were .	disgust	moviereview
11149	The film falls short on tension , eloquence , spiritual challenge -- things that have made the original New Testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries .	disgust	moviereview
11150	By the end of it all I sort of loved the people onscreen , even though I could not stand them .	joy	moviereview
11151	Perhaps the film should be seen as a conversation starter .	noemotion	moviereview
11152	It 's not an easy one to review .	noemotion	moviereview
11153	At best this is a film for the under-7 crowd .	disgust	moviereview

11155	And a very rainy day .	noemotion	moviereview

11159	Um , no. .	noemotion	moviereview

11162	The punch lines that miss , unfortunately , outnumber the hits by three-to-one .	disgust	moviereview
11163	But Death to Smoochy keeps firing until the bitter end .	joy	moviereview
11164	Mushes the college-friends genre -LRB- The Big Chill -RRB- together with the contrivances and overwrought emotion of soap operas .	disgust	moviereview
11165	Showtime 's starry cast could be both an asset and a detriment .	noemotion	moviereview
11166	Those who trek to the ` plex predisposed to like it probably will enjoy themselves .	joy	moviereview
11167	But ticket-buyers with great expectations will wind up as glum as Mr. De Niro .	sadness	moviereview
11168	A determined , ennui-hobbled slog that really does n't have much to say beyond the news flash that loneliness can make people act weird .	disgust	moviereview
11169	Too daft by half ... but supremely good natured .	joy	moviereview
11170	Fails in making this character understandable , in getting under her skin , in exploring motivation ... Well before the end , the film grows as dull as its characters , about whose fate it is hard to care .	disgust	moviereview
11171	It 's a shame that the storyline and its underlying themes ... finally seem so impersonal or even shallow .	disgust	moviereview

11177	Cattaneo reworks the formula that made The Full Monty a smashing success ... but neglects to add the magic that made it all work .	disgust	moviereview
11178	Routine and rather silly .	disgust	moviereview
11179	A rip-off twice removed , modeled after -LRB- Seagal 's -RRB- earlier copycat Under Siege , sometimes referred to as Die Hard on a boat .	disgust	moviereview
11180	Totally overwrought , deeply biased , and wholly designed to make you feel guilty about ignoring what the filmmakers clearly believe are The Greatest Musicians of All Time .	disgust	moviereview
11181	You can practically hear George Orwell turning over .	disgust	moviereview
11182	Behan 's memoir is great material for a film -- rowdy , brawny and lyrical in the best Irish sense -- but Sheridan has settled for a lugubrious romance .	joy	moviereview
11183	While Holm is terrific as both men and Hjejle quite appealing , the film fails to make the most out of the intriguing premise .	disgust	moviereview
11184	Lazy filmmaking , with the director taking a hands-off approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it 's compelling .	disgust	moviereview
11185	If it were any more of a turkey , it would gobble in Dolby Digital stereo .	disgust	moviereview
11186	If nothing else , `` Rollerball '' 2002 may go down in cinema history as the only movie ever in which the rest of the cast was outshined by LL Cool J.	disgust	moviereview
11187	A movie that falls victim to frazzled wackiness and frayed satire .	disgust	moviereview
11188	How do you make a movie with depth about a man who lacked any ?	disgust	moviereview
11189	On the evidence before us , the answer is clear : Not easily and , in the end , not well enough .	disgust	moviereview
11190	The film 's trailer also looked like crap , so crap is what I was expecting .	disgust	moviereview
11191	More trifle than triumph .	disgust	moviereview
11192	The movie is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction .	disgust	moviereview
11193	Festers in just such a dungpile that you 'd swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you .	disgust	moviereview
11194	Lyne 's latest , the erotic thriller Unfaithful , further demonstrates just how far his storytelling skills have eroded .	disgust	moviereview
11195	It sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss , and that 's more or less how it plays out .	disgust	moviereview
11196	Rumor , a muddled drama about coming to terms with death , feels impersonal , almost generic .	disgust	moviereview
11197	Report card : Does n't live up to the exalted tagline - there 's definite room for improvement .	disgust	moviereview
11198	Does n't deserve a passing grade -LRB- even on a curve -RRB- .	disgust	moviereview
11199	The pacing is deadly , the narration helps little and Naipaul , a juicy writer , is negated .	disgust	moviereview
11200	As his circle of friends keeps getting smaller one of the characters in Long Time Dead says ` I 'm telling you , this is f *** ed ' .	noemotion	moviereview

11203	Bean drops the ball too many times ... hoping the nifty premise will create enough interest to make up for an unfocused screenplay .	disgust	moviereview
11204	A well-acted , but one-note film .	joy	moviereview
11205	Blood Work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from Eastwood 's Dirty Harry period .	disgust	moviereview
11206	The movie is too amateurishly square to make the most of its own ironic implications .	disgust	moviereview
11207	-LRB- Lee -RRB- treats his audience the same way that Jim Brown treats his women -- as dumb , credulous , unassuming , subordinate subjects .	disgust	moviereview
11208	And Lee seems just as expectant of an adoring , wide-smiling reception .	joy	moviereview
11209	There 's not one decent performance from the cast and not one clever line of dialogue .	disgust	moviereview
11210	No amount of burning , blasting , stabbing , and shooting can hide a weak script .	disgust	moviereview
11211	It 's an odd show , pregnant with moods , stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise .	disgust	moviereview

11214	Earnest yet curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner .	disgust	moviereview
11215	Ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of Louis Begley 's source novel -LRB- About Schmidt -RRB- and an old Payne screenplay .	disgust	moviereview
11216	The exploitative , clumsily staged violence overshadows everything , including most of the actors .	disgust	moviereview

11224	Whether it 's the worst movie of 2002 , I ca n't say for sure : Memories of Rollerball have faded , and I skipped Country Bears .	disgust	moviereview
11225	But this new jangle of noise , mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title .	disgust	moviereview
11226	-LRB- A -RRB- boldly stroked , luridly coloured , uni-dimensional nonsense machine that strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain .	disgust	moviereview

11229	The first question to ask about Bad Company is why Anthony Hopkins is in it .	disgust	moviereview
11230	We assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce , because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low .	disgust	moviereview
11231	Not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general .	disgust	moviereview
11232	It merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them .	disgust	moviereview
11233	Shame on writer/director Vicente Aranda for making a florid biopic about mad queens , obsessive relationships , and rampant adultery so dull .	disgust	moviereview

11243	Blue Crush has all the trappings of an energetic , extreme-sports adventure , but ends up more of a creaky `` Pretty Woman '' retread , with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought .	disgust	moviereview

11251	The story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head .	disgust	moviereview
11252	Ultimately , Sarah 's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic , and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman 's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness .	disgust	moviereview
11253	It 's supposed to be a humorous , all-too-human look at how hope can breed a certain kind of madness -- and strength -- but it never quite adds up .	disgust	moviereview
11254	Feels more like a rejected X-Files episode than a credible account of a puzzling real-life happening .	disgust	moviereview
11255	Some motion pictures portray ultimate passion ; others create ultimate thrills .	joy	moviereview
11256	Men in Black II achieves ultimate insignificance -- it 's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as Whiffle-Ball epic .	disgust	moviereview
11257	An enigmatic film that 's too clever for its own good , it 's a conundrum not worth solving .	disgust	moviereview
11258	A zombie movie in every sense of the word -- mindless , lifeless , meandering , loud , painful , obnoxious .	disgust	moviereview

11262	Certainly not a good movie , but it was n't horrible either .	noemotion	moviereview
11263	Although it starts off so bad that you feel like running out screaming , it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful .	disgust	moviereview
11264	The result is so tame that even slightly wised-up kids would quickly change the channel .	disgust	moviereview
11265	It appears to have been modeled on the worst revenge-of-the-nerds clichs the filmmakers could dredge up .	disgust	moviereview

11268	It takes you somewhere you 're not likely to have seen before , but beneath the exotic surface -LRB- and exotic dancing -RRB- it 's surprisingly old-fashioned .	joy	moviereview
11269	While the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible Anne Rice novel it 's based upon , Queen Of The Damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle .	disgust	moviereview
11270	It should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring .	disgust	moviereview
11271	A good-looking but ultimately pointless political thriller with plenty of action and almost no substance .	disgust	moviereview
11272	A tired , predictable , bordering on offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid .	disgust	moviereview
11273	If Hill is n't quite his generation 's Don Siegel -LRB- or Robert Aldrich -RRB- , it 's because there 's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ; it 's all bluster and clich .	disgust	moviereview
11274	Stealing Harvard will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : A few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious .	disgust	moviereview
11275	This is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors .	disgust	moviereview
11276	Does anyone much think the central story of Brendan Behan is that he was a bisexual sweetheart before he took to drink ?	noemotion	moviereview

11283	Hate it because it 's lousy .	disgust	moviereview

11285	Like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they 're struggling to create .	disgust	moviereview
11286	The filmmakers are playing to the Big Boys in New York and L.A. To that end , they mock the kind of folks they do n't understand , ones they figure the power-lunchers do n't care to understand , either .	disgust	moviereview
11287	Competently directed but terminally cute drama .	joy	moviereview
11288	The big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing .	disgust	moviereview

11297	The work of an exhausted , desiccated talent who ca n't get out of his own way .	disgust	moviereview
11298	The main characters are simply named The Husband , The Wife and The Kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort .	disgust	moviereview
11299	In terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused .	disgust	moviereview
11300	Swims in mediocrity , sticking its head up for a breath of fresh air now and then .	disgust	moviereview
11301	The only type of lives this glossy comedy-drama resembles are ones in formulaic mainstream movies .	disgust	moviereview
11302	The characters ... are paper-thin , and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script .	disgust	moviereview
11303	A Sha-Na-Na sketch punctuated with graphic violence .	disgust	moviereview
11304	The trouble is , its filmmakers run out of clever ideas and visual gags about halfway through .	disgust	moviereview
11305	Spy-vs .	noemotion	moviereview
11306	- spy action flick with Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu never comes together .	anticipation	moviereview
11307	A so-so , made-for-TV something posing as a real movie .	disgust	moviereview
11308	The only upside to all of this unpleasantness is , given its Labor Day weekend upload , FearDotCom should log a minimal number of hits .	disgust	moviereview
11309	Whether this is art imitating life or life imitating art , it 's an unhappy situation all around .	sadness	moviereview
11310	An uneasy mix of run-of-the-mill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection .	surprise	moviereview
11311	A formula family tearjerker told with a heavy Irish brogue ... accentuating , rather than muting , the plot 's saccharine thrust .	joy	moviereview
11312	This is Sandler running on empty , repeating what he 's already done way too often .	disgust	moviereview
11313	This is as lax and limp a comedy as I 've seen in a while , a meander through worn-out material .	disgust	moviereview
11314	Time literally stops on a dime in the tries-so-hard-to-be-cool `` Clockstoppers , '' but that does n't mean it still wo n't feel like the longest 90 minutes of your movie-going life .	disgust	moviereview
11315	The sort of picture in which , whenever one of the characters has some serious soul searching to do , they go to a picture-perfect beach during sunset .	disgust	moviereview
11316	Aptly named , this shimmering , beautifully costumed and filmed production does n't work for me .	disgust	moviereview
11317	A preposterously melodramatic paean to gang-member teens in Brooklyn circa 1958 .	disgust	moviereview
11318	Has none of the crackle of `` Fatal Attraction '' , `` 9 1/2 Weeks '' , or even `` Indecent Proposal '' , and feels more like Lyne 's stolid remake of `` Lolita '' .	disgust	moviereview
11319	Everything its title implies , a standard-issue crime drama spat out from the Tinseltown assembly line .	disgust	moviereview
11320	An extraordinarily silly thriller .	disgust	moviereview
11321	A rehash of every gangster movie from the past decade .	disgust	moviereview
11322	Gaping plot holes sink this ` sub ' - standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm to crush depth .	disgust	moviereview
11323	Talkiness is n't necessarily bad , but the dialogue frequently misses the mark .	disgust	moviereview
11324	The beautiful images and solemn words can not disguise the slack complacency of -LRB- Godard 's -RRB- vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice .	disgust	moviereview
11325	The stunt work is top-notch ; the dialogue and drama often food-spittingly funny .	joy	moviereview
11326	The movie is n't painfully bad , something to be ` fully experienced ' ; it 's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten .	disgust	moviereview
11327	Charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past Love Story derisions .	disgust	moviereview
11328	What a great shame that such a talented director as Chen Kaige has chosen to make his English-language debut with a film so poorly plotted and scripted .	disgust	moviereview
11329	No amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story .	disgust	moviereview
11330	The film ... presents classic moral-condundrum drama : What would you have done to survive ?	noemotion	moviereview
11331	The problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of Auschwitz II-Birkenau .	disgust	moviereview
11332	... for all its social and political potential , State Property does n't end up being very inspiring or insightful .	disgust	moviereview
11333	A film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time , and this is n't .	disgust	moviereview
11334	Little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point ... is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable .	disgust	moviereview
11335	The nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations .	disgust	moviereview
11336	This is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy .	disgust	moviereview

11343	Koepp 's screenplay is n't nearly surprising or clever enough to sustain a reasonable degree of suspense on its own .	disgust	moviereview
11344	Is it really an advantage to invest such subtlety and warmth in an animatronic bear when the humans are acting like puppets ?	disgust	moviereview
11345	More successful at relating history than in creating an emotionally complex , dramatically satisfying heroine	disgust	moviereview
11346	Clumsy , obvious , preposterous , the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades .	disgust	moviereview
11347	It 's hard to pity the ` plain ' girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip-gloss .	disgust	moviereview
11348	Rather , pity anyone who sees this mishmash .	disgust	moviereview
11349	A banal , virulently unpleasant excuse for a romantic comedy .	disgust	moviereview
11350	The drama discloses almost nothing .	disgust	moviereview
11351	A minor-league soccer remake of The Longest Yard .	disgust	moviereview
11352	Belongs in the too-hot-for-TV direct-to-video/DVD category , and this is why I have given it a one-star rating .	disgust	moviereview
11353	As earnest as a community-college advertisement , American Chai is enough to make you put away the guitar , sell the amp , and apply to medical school .	disgust	moviereview
11354	A dim-witted and lazy spin-off of the Animal Planet documentary series , Crocodile Hunter is entertainment opportunism at its most glaring .	disgust	moviereview
11355	There is more than one joke about putting the toilet seat down .	disgust	moviereview
11356	And that should tell you everything you need to know about All the Queen 's Men .	noemotion	moviereview
11357	Even fans of Ismail Merchant 's work , I suspect , would have a hard time sitting through this one .	disgust	moviereview
11358	It 's really just another silly Hollywood action film , one among a multitude of simple-minded , yahoo-ing death shows .	disgust	moviereview
11359	It 's not a particularly good film , but neither is it a monsterous one .	noemotion	moviereview
11360	The world needs more filmmakers with passionate enthusiasms like Martin Scorsese .	joy	moviereview
11361	But it does n't need Gangs of New York .	noemotion	moviereview

11363	Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is deja vu all over again , and while that is a cliche , nothing could be more appropriate .	joy	moviereview

11365	Sade achieves the near-impossible : It turns the Marquis de Sade into a dullard .	joy	moviereview
11366	-LRB- Lin Chung 's -RRB- voice is rather unexceptional , even irritating -LRB- at least to this Western ear -RRB- , making it awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters .	anger	moviereview
11367	One of the most plain , unimaginative romantic comedies I 've ever seen .	disgust	moviereview
11368	Though there 's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film 's direction , the drama feels rigged and sluggish .	disgust	moviereview
11369	Unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making .	disgust	moviereview
11370	Unless there are zoning ordinances to protect your community from the dullest science fiction , Impostor is opening today at a theater near you .	disgust	moviereview
11371	It should be doing a lot of things , but does n't .	disgust	moviereview
11372	Chen films the resolutely downbeat Smokers Only with every indulgent , indie trick in the book .	disgust	moviereview
11373	... a rather bland affair .	disgust	moviereview
11374	Far-fetched premise , convoluted plot , and thematic mumbo jumbo about destiny and redemptive love .	disgust	moviereview

11381	The filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart .	disgust	moviereview
11382	Rather than real figures , Elling and Kjell Bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the naf 's encounter with the world .	disgust	moviereview
11383	Mariah Carey gives us another peek at some of the magic we saw in Glitter here in Wisegirls .	joy	moviereview

11467	While the new film is much more eye-catching than its blood-drenched Stephen Norrington-directed predecessor , the new script by the returning David S. Goyer is much sillier .	disgust	moviereview
11468	In addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history , Ballistic : Ecks Vs. Sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase .	disgust	moviereview
11469	It shares the first two films ' loose-jointed structure , but laugh-out-loud bits are few and far between .	disgust	moviereview

11487	Still , the updated Dickensian sensibility of writer Craig Bartlett 's story is appealing .	joy	moviereview
11488	True to its title , it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at .	disgust	moviereview

11494	It collapses when Mr. Taylor tries to shift the tone to a thriller 's rush .	disgust	moviereview
11495	Any film that does n't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss .	disgust	moviereview
11496	... Blade II is still top-heavy with blazing guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts , disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves .	disgust	moviereview
11497	The Rules of Attraction gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing .	disgust	moviereview
11498	Though there are many tense scenes in Trapped , they prove more distressing than suspenseful .	disgust	moviereview
11499	In this film we at least see a study in contrasts ; the wide range of one actor , and the limited range of a comedian .	disgust	moviereview

11508	If that does n't clue you in that something 's horribly wrong , nothing will .	disgust	moviereview
11509	Director Tom Shadyac and star Kevin Costner glumly mishandle the story 's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself .	disgust	moviereview

11511	Like the Tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on	disgust	moviereview

11513	A film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen .	disgust	moviereview
11514	It 's a feel-bad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer 's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary .	disgust	moviereview

11520	You come away thinking not only that Kate is n't very bright , but that she has n't been worth caring about and that maybe she , Janine and Molly -- an all-woman dysfunctional family -- deserve one another .	disgust	moviereview
11521	The metaphors are provocative , but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery .	disgust	moviereview
11522	Very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all .	disgust	moviereview
11523	Too much power , not enough puff .	sadness	moviereview
11524	The attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show .	disgust	moviereview
11525	It 's provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by Taylor 's cartoonish performance and the film 's ill-considered notion that Hitler 's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances .	disgust	moviereview
11526	A cellophane-pop remake of the punk classic Ladies and Gentlemen , The Fabulous Stains ... Crossroads is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential .	disgust	moviereview

11536	There are many definitions of ` time waster ' but this movie must surely be one of them .	disgust	moviereview
11537	As it stands , Crocodile Hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the 1959 Godzilla , which combined scenes of a Japanese monster flick with canned shots of Raymond Burr commenting on the monster 's path of destruction .	disgust	moviereview

13135	I hope that he can learn to play well and I really do hope he is enjoying himself.	anticipation	blog
13136	No matter the pain is may cause the rest of the family.	sadness	blog
13137	Perhaps a nice hot bubble bath and a bottle of rum would help.	anticipation	blog
13138	I wonder how long he will practice for.	anticipation	blog
13139	Vegas was a lot of fun.	joy	blog
13140	The reception was a friggen blast.	joy	blog
13141	Champagne, music, and me trying to catch those damn flowers.	joy	blog
13142	didn't catch em by the by Imagine this: My bro taking his neck tie off of marie's thigh with his teeth while girls just wanna have fun blasts in the background.	noemotion	blog
13143	We went shooting in our regular spot out in the desert behind this mountain.	noemotion	blog
13144	add some jack and cokes and a wendy's drive through and it's a REAL party.	joy	blog
13145	My bro is leaving for Iraq again and, well, you know how that goes.	sadness	blog
13146	As Sean put it, it's not like Vietnam where 4 of 5 americans will die, so that really put it into perspective for me. I know he'll be safe and come home in one piece, but the scary thought still kinda lingers in the background of my mind.	fear	blog
13147	Everybody hates everybody, everybody lies, talks shit behind backs, and treats people like shit.	disgust	blog
13148	My mother truly wants to murder my father, and then gets pissed off when i don't agree with her.	anger	blog
13149	you, i'd say that's some fucked up shit.	disgust	blog
13150	happy, It was the perfect end to a crappy day.	joy	blog
13151	Basically, I just want to focus on staying busy and staying happy.	anticipation	blog
13152	So, if you would like to contribute to the make me smile foundation, let's party.	joy	blog
13153	after school I went home and got ready to go the the Homecoming parade.	anticipation	blog
13154	We won by several of points.	joy	blog
13155	after the game we went to the dance where I had the best night of my life.	joy	blog
13156	I cant even explain in words how much fun I had.	joy	blog
13157	I can honestly say that was the best Homecomg ever.	joy	blog
13158	Its soooo sad b/c it was my last one.	sadness	blog
13159	sad at least I had a blast.	sadness	blog
13160	I dont know what else to say except that I love spending time w/ Joe.	joy	blog
13161	happy *sighs* laughing out loud.	joy	blog
13162	And hanging out w/ Celeste and Matt was totally awesome 2.	joy	blog
13163	It's been a solid half year since I sent word out, and I will now attempt to encapsulate the last six months into one last epic email.	anticipation	blog
13164	I believe it was April, and spring had just arrived.	noemotion	blog
13165	I'll start my narrative with a little anecdote about how small the world really is. So I was going to work one day, headed to one of the hostels around Berlin to pick people up for the tour, and then bring them back to the Brandenburg Gate where the tour starts.	noemotion	blog
13166	I had never been to this particular hostel before, and as I entered and gave my little spiel about the tour and asked if anyone wanted to come along, I was met not with a roar of enthusiasm from the hostel residents, but rather a few dull, glass-eyed looks and was generally ignored.	sadness	blog
13167	As I was preparing to leave, one guy over at the computers yelled out for me to wait, approached me and said hello.	surprise	blog
13168	He had arrived twenty minutes beforehand at the hostel, hadn't even checked in yet, and just happened to be in the lobby when I was.	surprise	blog
13169	We had a great time catching up, and went out that night together as well.	joy	blog
13170	But it's certainly strange how you randomly run in to people you haven't seen in years, in little hole-in-the-walls in Europe.	surprise	blog
13171	The rest of April passed rather uneventfully, and in May I went to see a production of Faust Part I at the Deutsches Theater.	noemotion	blog
13172	And this particular piece was by far the best play I have EVER seen.	joy	blog
13173	It was also incredibly simple, cutting the normally huge cast down to only seven performers.	noemotion	blog
13174	It's moments like that that remind me why I've chosen theatre as a profession.	joy	blog
13175	My next big adventure was a trip I took to London at the end of May. I had never been before, and had been planning on this trip for about six months.	anticipation	blog
13176	I was lucky enough to be able to stay with some friends to cut down on the cost, and see a different side of London life.	joy	blog
13177	I saw most of the major sites on my own, and I went to the theater almost every night I was there.	joy	blog
13178	The show was trash.	disgust	blog
13179	Horribly acted, horribly directed, weak script.	disgust	blog
13180	And interminably long.	disgust	blog
13181	I wanted to leave at intermission, but my date was really enjoying it should have been a sign so we stayed.	disgust	blog
13182	I guess the one good thing I took from it was that I know now that the British are just as capable as we are of producing really awful work.	disgust	blog
13183	It was nice to understand that, just wish I didn't have to experience it first hand.	sadness	blog
13184	The performers were incredible, and one of the generals was played by Geoffrey, the butler from Fresh Prince of Bellaire.	joy	blog
13185	That in itself was hilarious, and made us love the show even more.	joy	blog
13186	I also saw Les Miserables for the first time, and it was fun.	joy	blog
13187	And the funniest part, the two statues said they were donated by New Zealand.	joy	blog
13188	next time you're in Wellington, watch out for the Kiwi Commies.	fear	blog
13189	Now I have a confession to make: before the World Cup began I had actually never seen an entire soccer game from start to finish.	noemotion	blog
13190	The hordes of people would change from day to day, for instance there was a three day period where we had over 90,000 Swedes in the city, leading up to their dramatic defeat at the hands of Zeh Germans.	noemotion	blog
13191	Then there were the Brazilians, everywhere, singing-clapping-dancing-taking pictures, and of course the pale and pasty Brits with their cock-eyed stares and drinking songs.	joy	blog
13192	I didn't have tickets to any of the games, but my group of friends would always go to a cafe or bar of the nationality that was playing to watch the match.	noemotion	blog
13193	So to a French cafe for the France-Swiss game, a Tapas bar when Spain played, drank Caiprinhas with the passionate Brazilians, etc. It was a colorful and hilarious way to take part without fighting the crowds.	joy	blog
13194	And let me tell you how good the World Cup was for Berlin as a city, and Germany as a nation.	joy	blog
13195	Another interesting element was the latent patriotism that emerged during the Cup.	noemotion	blog
13196	Now this merits explaining: before the World Cup began, if you waved a German flag in the streets, you would probably be called a Nazi and at the very least labeled as a radical right wing nutter.	fear	blog
13197	You have to understand that the Germans have had a really difficult time with their national identity and subsequently national pride or patriotism of any kind since the Second World War.	sadness	blog
13198	And for what it's worth I agree with them, it makes me nervous too.	fear	blog
13199	People were genuinely excited about supporting their national team, and taking pride in its accomplishments.	joy	blog
13200	Now this newfound enthusiasm certainly was not shared by everyone.	noemotion	blog
13201	In fact the entire month of June was one continuous debate in the media between prominent politicians, celebrities, writers such as Guenther Grass and Christa Wolf, and other intellectuals about the meaning, origin and impact of this nationalism.	noemotion	blog
13202	And of course no one can laboriously dissect an idea better than the Germans.	noemotion	blog
13203	But the general consensus after five weeks of debate was that the newfound national pride was a positive thing.	joy	blog
13204	In June I had also been training at work to lead tours of Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp, which I started at the end of the month.	noemotion	blog
13205	This camp, about 40 miles north of Berlin was the second major camp to be opened in the Nazi system, and was also used by the Russians after the war to intern former Nazi's and anyone else deemed an 'enemy of the state'.	noemotion	blog
13206	Given the dark history of such a place you can well imagine the difficulty of retelling that information, and trying to put it into some kind of historical context.	noemotion	blog
13207	After a July of beautiful weather and great summer adventures, I traveled with my good Australian friend Kurt to a theater festival in Cyprus.	joy	blog
13208	The occasion was that a good friend of mine from North Texas, Jessica, was playing the title role in Medea at a theater festival there.	noemotion	blog
13209	I was planning on going to Greece sometime anyway, so we spent three days in Athens, and two and a half in Cyprus.	joy	blog
13210	The city is a sweaty, dirty, polluted hole.	disgust	blog
13211	Take your impression of a squalor-filled Mediterranean capital, and add this to your image: 10 story apartment buildings everywhere, in 100 degree heat, all cooled by wall-mounted air conditioners, a.k.a. swamp boxes.	disgust	blog
13212	Now take into account that said air conditioners are mounted on the windows, sticking out over the street.	noemotion	blog
13213	Now imagine the condensation from thousands of swamp box coolers pitter pattering on your head as you stroll down the trashy Athens streets.	disgust	blog
13214	And the city itself really is lovely, in it's own way.	joy	blog
13215	We took a day trip out to Sunion, the very tip of Greece, to see the temple of Poseidon.	noemotion	blog
13216	It took us about two hours to get out there, and then we climbed around and played on the rocks for about an hour, taking pics of the magnificent old temple ruin that is literally clinging to the cliff face.	joy	blog
13217	And then we watched in amazement with fifty other tourists as the sun went down in front of the temple, over the Mediterranean.	joy	blog
13218	The sky is so amazing in Greece, it feels like you could really reach up and touch it, it's so close.	surprise	blog
13219	And of course this just enhanced the magic of the sunset, as the red orb of  the sun ever so slowly retreated behind the furthest hill.	joy	blog
13220	We saw Jessica's production of Medea, and were treated incredibly well by her colleagues at the festival.	joy	blog
13221	We stayed in a tiny mountain village called Droushia, and these people brought hospitality to incredible new heights.	joy	blog
13222	They did everything they could to make us feel welcome, everything from putting us up in a beautiful hotel, refusing to let us pay for anything, and making sure that our stay on their island was as enchanting as the stories always make it out to be.	joy	blog
13223	We spent pretty much the whole day outside of a decadent lunch at the beach house in the water.	joy	blog
13224	Tomorrow we'll go somewhere special.	anticipation	blog
13225	The next morning, the last day of the festival, they piled us all into four wheel drive vehicles, and took us off the map to an area that I will henceforth be labeling The Blue Lagoon.	joy	blog
13226	Imagine the most incredible, horseshoe shaped cove, with unimaginably blue water, and a giant stone underneath the water, hundreds of meters long and wide, adding depth to the color.	joy	blog
13227	Our hosts had brought along a lunch of fresh fruit and we broke our fast on a cliff overlooking the whole gorgeous expanse.	joy	blog
13228	It was really interesting staying with them in this little mountain village, and getting to experience a bit of what their culture was all about.	joy	blog
13229	They make their own very strong coffee, and Haloumi cheese, which we were told a hundred different times by all the little old ladies was goat cheese.	joy	blog
13230	Don't ever mistake Haloumi for Feta, or you might have a flock of barely intelligible Cypriot grammas spend half an hour pinching your cheek and explaining the difference in broken Greco-English.	surprise	blog
13231	Its really a testament to the vision of the ancients that in our world of skyscrapers and technical gadgetry, we are still fascinated by a two thousand year-old arrangement of stones.	other	blog
13232	After returning from Greece my last few weeks in Berlin passed very quickly.	noemotion	blog
13233	I was leading loads of tours, and working on a short film I was directing.	noemotion	blog
13234	The time flew by and before I knew it, August was at an end and my doorstep was graced by my best friend Lance, who had come to Berlin for my last week.	surprise	blog
13235	So I spent the next six days in a haze of working my final tours, partying, and showing Lance the city that I had come to love so much over the last two years.	joy	blog
13236	Lance and I spent the better part of the next three days lounging around Zurich and drinking in Switzerland.	noemotion	blog
13237	We went on a walking tour, went to the City Museum located in an old castle, very cool, and had a good time relaxing and enjoying the AMAZING views.	joy	blog
13238	The city is incredibly beautiful, tucked into the Alps and right on the water.	joy	blog
13239	I think the most important thing I can say about this city, is that all of the rumors: That the city's dirty, the people are rude, the language barrier is insurmountable, the metro is incomprehensible, you things will be stolen, that they hate Americans.	anger	blog
13240	It's called the city of love and light for a reason.	joy	blog
13241	The Eiffel Tower is breathtaking, and seeing it in person destroys its cliche and makes you fall in love with the thing.	joy	blog
13242	We encountered so many genuinely wonderful, helpful, content people.	joy	blog
13243	Everything from trying to order a baguette in the morning my Francais is tres terrible to asking directions or talking to cabbies, we were always pleasantly surprised at how open and welcoming they were.	surprise	blog
13244	They know how beautiful it is, and they appreciate it.	joy	blog
13245	And man, it is gorgeous.	joy	blog
13246	There was a fabulous sense of community there.	joy	blog
13247	My favorite part about the city parks were the 'nap chairs'.	joy	blog
13248	We noticed that about half of the chairs were slanted at a 45 degree angle.	noemotion	blog
13249	I thought: that's strange, what's that about.	surprise	blog
13250	We found out when we headed over to two of these chairs that were situated in the shade, and plopped down.	noemotion	blog
13251	They were perfect for taking a catnap.	joy	blog
13252	We looked around and noticed that there were lots of people all over the park, in the municipal nap chairs, taking a snooze.	noemotion	blog
13253	What other city would use tax payer dollars to provide napping chairs in a public park.	disgust	blog
13254	We went to Versailles, we went to Notre Dame, and on a fabulous bike tour.	joy	blog
13255	The most interesting thing we learned on the bike tour was that when the revolutionaries stormed the Bastille, there were only 7 prisoners left in it.	surprise	blog
13256	6 were petty thieves and the seventh was a boy whose father had sent him there for a few weeks as  disciplinary measure.	noemotion	blog
13257	Montmartre, the old bohemian artist district, five minutes from the Sacre Coeur Cathedral.	noemotion	blog
13258	Every night after dinner we'd climb the hill to the cathedral and sit on the steps.	joy	blog
13259	The Cathedral is the highest point in Paris, and from its northerly vantage point, you have the entire city spread out at your feet.	noemotion	blog
13260	On the steps there was always sort of an impromptu party with musicians and performers and other city-watchers gathering with a bottle of wine and a merry spirit.	joy	blog
13261	Those evenings on the steps are some of my favorite memories from Paris.	joy	blog
13262	Upon arrival back in the states, we changed clothes and went directly to a Counting Crows concert, which was my birthday present from Lance.	joy	blog
13263	What an incredible end to an incredible journey.	joy	blog
13264	It took me to 11 different countries and incalculable new experiences.	joy	blog
13265	I've returned ready for a fresh start, collecting new experiences on this side of the pond.	anticipation	blog
13266	I was also lucky enough to be hired to direct a show for Frenship high school, which went up last Sunday.	joy	blog
13267	It was a Commedia dell'Arte piece titled The Red Hat, and went extremely well.	joy	blog
13268	It was a nice way for me to get to stretch those theater muscles and earn a little something at the same time.	joy	blog
13269	And though my European adventure is over for the moment my American one starts tomorrow.	anticipation	blog
13270	I'm moving to Chicago Sunday morning, in the hopes of getting started there as an director and performer.	anticipation	blog
13271	I'm excited about the move, and the opportunities and challenges that await me there.	anticipation	blog
13272	I hope all of you are well; that you have made it through the summer, and are excited about the upcoming rapidly approaching holiday season.	anticipation	blog
13273	I wish you all a fabulous week, and a warm and safe start to the wintry season.	joy	blog
13274	But math just sucks, and I've accepted that.	disgust	blog
13275	Some of my teachers seem quite amazing, and others I know for a fact to be amazing.	joy	blog
13276	So, all-in-all, pretty good, right.	joy	blog
13277	Honestly, while I was dating the child, I barely saw him in school.	noemotion	blog
13278	Now, I see him all the time, and I'm pretty sure he'll be right outside the door my photography room after class every day for the rest of this trimester.	noemotion	blog
13279	Unless Brandon and Meg break up, that is.  Which is unlikely, so I shouldn't even hope on that one.	anticipation	blog
13280	I also found out that Junior year, will, in fact, be a bitch.	disgust	blog
13281	I have recieved homework in four of my seven classes.	noemotion	blog
13282	AP World is going to be the hardest thing I'll ever do academically, anyway.	anticipation	blog
13283	You can handle high school drama. Also, I have so many friends, and all of them are true, caring, trustworthy friends who love me and are supporting me 100%.	trust	blog
13284	I can come through this year triumphantly and with grace.	joy	blog
13285	This is the year where everything happens.	anticipation	blog
13286	I also found out that Junior year, will, in fact, be a bitch.	fear	blog
13287	I have recieved homework in four of my seven classes.	noemotion	blog
13288	AP World is going to be the hardest thing I'll ever do academically, anyway.	anticipation	blog
13289	You can deal with this, Nyssa.	trust	blog
13290	I can come through this year triumphantly and with grace.	joy	blog
13291	This is the year where everything happens.	anticipation	blog
13292	This is my year to try new things and to succeed.	anticipation	blog
13293	This is my first year of loving myself.	joy	blog
13294	I look forward to learning and discovering even more of who I am, and loving every inch of it.	anticipation	blog
13295	I cannot believe the nerve of this man. God.	anger	blog
13296	I think I'd really like to talk to you right now.	anticipation	blog
13297	at least they punched holes in it that is my BIO lab course book.	noemotion	blog
13298	What's even worse, it's copied so poorly that the last half inch of text on the far right side of the page is cut off, so as I try to read in preparation for the lab tomorrow I'm trying to coherently complete sentences and make sense of it all, which is often impossible because so much is left out.	disgust	blog
13299	AND we're required to have this new kind of remote control clicker which none of the libraries have for free check out, so I have to pay $20 +$12.50 activation fee for something that doesn't work consistently, eats batteries, and will provide me with 3 and a half months of use.	anger	blog
13300	That's like, four or five or more meals.	noemotion	blog
13301	Can you tell I buy books with my own money.	noemotion	blog
13302	They pay room and board, and tuition and that's it.	noemotion	blog
13303	Which is the bulk of my expenses, but I'm paying for my food outside of campus meal plan food, and my books, and whatever else I need.	noemotion	blog
13304	I am in such a bad mood and I'm playing the blame game in my head, getting angry at people for things that are really quite trivial.	anger	blog
13305	I forgot how demeaning BME classes are.	anger	blog
13306	Dr. Roy, my prof for BME 314 expects us to have taken an Anatomy/Physiology class at some point in our lives.	anticipation	blog
13307	He was asking all these questions that I was completely baffled by and people were just spouting answers.	surprise	blog
13308	Sometimes I wonder how in the world I made it in, and every day I wonder how I'm going to make it through.	fear	blog
13309	Matt and I decided that BME really isn't a good undergrad major, there's a reason it's generally proposed as a Master's degree.	noemotion	blog
13310	I mean, we already need 133 ish hours to graduate which, for you non college people, is about 8-10 more than any engineering major and more than that more for a non engineering major.	anger	blog
13311	In addition to that, we keep encountering classes where the professor expects you to have taken general classes that you haven't the anatomy/physiology is one, and thermodynamics is another one that Matt is having a problem with.	surprise	blog
13312	I need to find a good time/place where I can go pray and unwind.	anticipation	blog
13313	I don't feel like I ever have that kind of privacy where I can talk to God and cry and figure things out.	sadness	blog
13314	I always tear up in church too, for different reasons.	sadness	blog
13315	I love the way God brings people together.	joy	blog
13316	Ok. I'm feeling somewhat better now.	joy	blog
13317	Girls, I highly reccomend In Her Shoes, especially if you have a sister I'm enjoying it immensely and it has effectively distracted from my schoolwork almost all day.	joy	blog
13318	I think I spent the better part of two hours reading today.	noemotion	blog
13319	I learned that the Life Sciences library in the main building has exceedingly comfortable couches Anyhoo.	noemotion	blog
13320	Two harmless classes tomorrow and then that lovely 4 hour biology lab that I'm dreading.	fear	blog
13321	Right now, I'm sitting on a back deck overlooking a moderately busy street, smoking a cheap cigar, listening to music, letting its vibrations move my cogitations to.	joy	blog
13322	These small indicators remind me that, in the Silvia Plath sense of the concept, I'm dying.	sadness	blog
13323	Someday I will be no more than slime coating the expensive, cushiony, velvety inside of a coffin.	sadness	blog
13324	The rickety deck I'm sitting on could fall, I could catch a stray bullet to the noggin on my way to my car in the parking lot, I could be nailed by a drunk, inattentive, careless, or simply unfortunate driver on the way home.	fear	blog
13325	These are all unlikely, but they happen.	surprise	blog
13326	My mortality is nothing new, but I constantly have to ponder what I desire to take, achieve, or feel in this life.	anticipation	blog
13327	Should I strive to be in someone's history book as the dude that invented.	noemotion	blog
13328	or do I simply want to live an average American life and be remembered under a large stone in a well kept cemetery, forgotten after my immediate reletaves, children, and grand children.	anticipation	blog
13329	Or should I sink my money into trying to acquire more and live in a Parade of Homes house with yuppie vehicles in the front, a Mastercraft boat with a huge ski rack, the list can go on and on.	anticipation	blog
13330	What happens when I die.	anticipation	blog
13331	Should I start devoting myself to God, if there is such a being, in hopes of making it to Heaven.	anticipation	blog
13332	There would be a constant trepedation that there is no gold at the end of that rainbow.	fear	blog
13333	No wonder past writers were able to produce their amazing feats of feeling and thought.	joy	blog
13334	My thoughts at the moment are somewhat melancholy, but can be completely forgotten at the push of a button mounted to an  Xbox, Dvd player, or VCR.	sadness	blog
13335	For the laziness in me, I feel compelled to fold my laptop, plug it in, and simply watch, but this whole trainwreck, a malformed offspring of a feeble mind, has to come to an end somehow.	disgust	blog
13336	The first words that come to mind are in closing or to conclude, and then I quickly write a summary of what I just finished writing.	noemotion	blog
13337	Maybe I should stop in mid sentence, just to.	noemotion	blog
13338	I am now the proud father of Daisy Alexandria Davolls.	joy	blog
13339	Its all official, we sorted it out at the civic centre on Friday.	joy	blog
13340	I now have a sweet little thing, that totally depends on her mum and me to do whats best.	joy	blog
13341	I have the foresight of Supernanny and Honey we're killing the kids etc to thank as well as my own morals and my parents and peers too.	joy	blog
13342	Its a funny old game life, but I think I am one step closer to understanding its purpose and meaning now.	anticipation	blog
13343	I had a long hard look at my life over the last 14 days, and to be honest I wept.	sadness	blog
13344	I wept for all the mistakes I made where I put my feelings before the feelings of others.	sadness	blog
13345	I wept for all the times I said f*ck you instead of thank you.	sadness	blog
13346	I still have a couple of vices, strong coffee and noodles, but have quit smoking, havent drunk for a couple of weeks and am feeling better about life.	joy	blog
13347	My job is going really well, and I am getting a kick out of both going to work and coming home.	joy	blog
13348	The pessimist in me awaits the phone call from the police or hospital or nuclear plant etc telling me the worst, crushing my hopes of a better tomorrow.	fear	blog
13349	We are all essentially the same person.	trust	blog
13350	other then physical attributes - what really makes us so different from one another.	noemotion	blog
13351	we both have the same tools a brain so why can't I come up with a grad theory of relativity.	sadness	blog
13352	The brain is an amazing tool and can be sculpted for any purpose.	joy	blog
13353	I believe all brains start out with the same potential and the way they are grown and shaped determined how they operate on default for the rest of your life unless you do something about it.	anticipation	blog
13354	Have you ever met anyone without a fully developed brain.	noemotion	blog
13355	Listlessly they scratch at there head and the chains of thought don't delve to deep.	disgust	blog
13356	Do they know how lucky they are - to find contentment without looking.	joy	blog
13357	more often you find things to bring you down or worry about.	sadness	blog
13358	A single lightning bolt from the sky can make a lifetime of panic and worry all worthless.	fear	blog
13359	I think it is very easy to understand people once you realize that all people carry all the same personalities - just expressed to different proportions and degrees.	noemotion	blog
13360	True wisdom is growing your brain in all directions.	noemotion	blog
13361	Life is finding the balance between compulsion and carelessness.	noemotion	blog
13362	I am not saying I am anything other then happy - but I strive for a balance.	noemotion	blog
13363	the perfect combination of all attributes.	joy	blog
13364	of a person or state of mind having no emotion lacking or too strong; stable : a balanced personality.	noemotion	blog
13365	Happiness comes from within - your brain is a self regulating chemical factory.	joy	blog
13366	but when you try to become your own mental chemist - ingesting chemicals to alter your feelings - you screw up the balance.	noemotion	blog
13367	The testes stop producing testosterone because it senses there is already too much testosterone in the system.	noemotion	blog
13368	as a result - the balls shrink up and shut down.	noemotion	blog
13369	The body is lazy - if you provide something for it - it stops providing for itself.	disgust	blog
13370	For example - the more you use chapstick - the less your lips produce their own moisture - making you further dependent on chapstick.	noemotion	blog
13371	Happiness lies within - the only way to be truly happy is to create it yourself and not rely on other people or things.	noemotion	blog
13372	the Happiness they bring is only temporary.	sadness	blog
13373	Yet often that temporary happiness is more intense then a balanced contentment.	noemotion	blog
13374	It is however usually accompanied by and equal sadness - it is life's way of balancing itself out in the endless pendulum swing of life.	sadness	blog
13375	So, this morning I get a phone call from my sister.	surprise	blog
13376	First she is all mad because I haven't called her back in a week.	sadness	blog
13377	Second of all she is laughing hysterically because she had to put her dog on doggie drugs because the dog learned how to open the window to get out and seems to be jewish because she likes the temple down the road.	joy	blog
13378	Third she starts asking why I have only posted pics, so my dear sister, this is for you.	trust	blog
13379	She wouldn;t come down today so instead of being bored out of my mind I went antiquing.	noemotion	blog
13380	I figure I have a couple extra bucks so I budget a certain amount.	noemotion	blog
13381	Ok, I spent 4 times what I budgeted, but I wanted that desk.	joy	blog
13382	I was dragged away, it will be there tomorrow and I can go back alone.	noemotion	blog
13383	She didn;t give the dealer a chance to correct the problem, she paid a astronomical amount for new tires without telling the dealer and expected the dealer to reimburse her the full amount.	disgust	blog
13384	I called the mechanic and inquired about it.	anticipation	blog
13385	On that car, it won't affect alignment.	noemotion	blog
13386	She started questioning my credentials because she drives a school bus for a living and knows what a safe vehicle is. Bitch.	disgust	blog
13387	I have twice the work experience required for the job and I have alot more schooling than is required.	anticipation	blog
13388	So when she writes her letter to the Commissioner and the director of vehicle safety reads my report, he will understand why I appear not to take her side.	noemotion	blog
13389	They saw what I meant when they started eating it.	noemotion	blog
13390	Killin me he is. He's a great guy and I want to marry him for his kitchen, he liked that one, hahaha.	joy	blog
13391	Well, what can I say, he has a great kitchen, and the best cooking stuff, he doesn't even cook.	surprise	blog
13392	He's a great guy and I think the world of him.	joy	blog
13393	I had Stars Don't Shine stuck in my head earlier, and started singing it aloud to try and figure out what song it was, until I realized, too late, that it was Paris Hilton.	noemotion	blog
13394	Our emotions are a gift from God.	joy	blog
13395	But in order to recieve the blessing we must first realize that our emotions are always connected to a need being met or unmet.	trust	blog
13396	By listening to our emotions and asking ourselves why we are feeling a particular emotion we can discover an unmet need or a need that has been satisfied.	noemotion	blog
13397	For instance, if I feel sad because I have not seen my family in a long time my need for connection has not been met.	sadness	blog
13398	On the otherhand, if I feel happy because I have spent time with my family then my need for connection has been met.	joy	blog
13399	How many times have we felt angry and as a result insulted, judged, criticized, blamed or physically hurt someone.	anger	blog
13400	We live in a society that has encourages us to stuff our emotions and a society that is by the most part feelings illiterate.	disgust	blog
13401	Well, for starters become aware of what we are feeling.	disgust	blog
13402	Once we put our finger on the emotion we are feeling we can then go on to vocalize it.	anticipation	blog
13403	Marshall Rosenberg, author of Nonviolent Communication, has a four-step process for communication that incorporates identifying our feelings and needs into the model.	anticipation	blog
13404	Part of that model involves asking the question, I am feeling because I am needing.	sadness	blog
13405	Rosenberg also calls this four step process giraffe language.	noemotion	blog
13406	The heart is about 3 feet long and 3 inches thick all around.	surprise	blog
13407	The idea is that Nonviolent communication, which focuses on feelings and needs is the language of the heart because it focuses on what is alive in the heart.	anticipation	blog
13408	By stating our feelings and needs to others we avoid blaming and criticizing them.	trust	blog
13409	We can then go on to making a request instead of a demand to help ourselves satisfy our now recognized need.	anticipation	blog
13410	When others are angry or upset with us we can also use this technique on them.	noemotion	blog
13411	We can ask them, Are you feeling because you are needing.	noemotion	blog
13412	If we are not correct they will correct us and we will be closer to identifying the need they have and finding a way to resolve the situation.	trust	blog
13413	By satisfying our needs and the needs of others we can reach a fair negotiation.	joy	blog
13414	We can make a list of these feelings and be on the look out for them.	noemotion	blog
13415	It may be that we need to take a timeout when we feel these feelings to avoid a conflict.	fear	blog
13416	For instance, if we feel furious it may be better to take a one hour timeout and calm down.	anger	blog
13417	Then when we are calm, focus on sharing our feelings and needs with others.	noemotion	blog
13418	Many times in the past we have reacted like a lion when we feel angry or frustrated with others or ourselves.	noemotion	blog
13419	Taking time to focus on our feelings and needs helps us not let the lion out and speak from the heart that language of the giraffe with ourselves and others.	joy	blog
13420	Had one hell of a good vanila milkshake at Hard Rock Cafe, lets just say it was a 'satisfying' moment.	joy	blog
13421	Rome was fun with my best friend hanz, we managed to run out of money by the end and had mcDs for dinner at Florence.	joy	blog

13432	I talked to Misha earlier on MSN for the first time since I added her and yeah, it was fun I guess.	joy	blog
13433	I called Dad a few minutes ago on my cell and they were at her house so I guess she was out of the hospital.	joy	blog
13434	I need to clean my room up but I don't feel up to it.	sadness	blog
13435	I don't know why, I'm just drained of energy and want to cry constantly and for somereason I don't know why.	sadness	blog
13436	I don't know what happened to my happiness, I woke up feeling down and miserable and infact it's worse.	sadness	blog
13437	I'm losing enjoyment out of things I love to do and thats never a good sign.	sadness	blog
13438	I don't even feel like doing anything right now and I'm having force myself to update this journal.	sadness	blog
13439	The conversation was funny, I mentioned that if the word got out about our plans we'd have to escape the earth to avoid the police, HOLY/HOLD, the military and etc and yeah super hilarious J.C. suggested she could try and make a ship but then I suggested we could sneak into NASA and steal a rocket.	joy	blog
13440	it was hilarious.	joy	blog

13443	I need something better to do, I'm just loafing around on Gaia like I always do.	disgust	blog
13444	I can live with that, I wish I had something to do though._.; I feel lonely.	sadness	blog
13445	I probably won't take a shower until my parents get back.	noemotion	blog
13446	I dunno what else to say though except it's shocking that I'm updating early.	surprise	blog
13447	Other than that I also got a extension from my affiliate to get the fanlisiting I adopted up since the server move and etc. Meh, I miss Cassy.	sadness	blog
13448	Theres nothing left to say so this is the end of my journal entry.	noemotion	blog
13449	It's yet another white man insensitivity subject that even has socialists and revolutionaries saying 'hey, hold on a second!'.	disgust	blog
13450	Yes, the veils that many Muslim women around the world traditionally wear.	noemotion	blog
13451	I'm not going to get into the wrongs and rights, just to give a bit of perspective.	noemotion	blog
13452	I see the words veil and headscarf being used by white Europeans in many contradictory contexts.	noemotion	blog
13453	Hijab is a headscarf that covers the hair and usually wraps around the neck.	noemotion	blog
13454	The veil is often interpreted as being the ninja outfit, where womens heads are completely covered so as to see only the eyes, or in some cases nothing at all.	noemotion	blog
13455	For clarification the difference should be noted.	noemotion	blog
13456	And it is believed that women should practice modesty both for themselves but to keep the gazing eyes of man down.	noemotion	blog
13457	The veil that covers the entire face is called the nikab.	noemotion	blog
13458	Islam requires women to be modest, henceforth many of them wear the hijab, or headscarf.	noemotion	blog
13459	The nikab, or taliban style cover, is not an Islamic practice.	anger	blog
13460	A Fatwa, or Islamic legal pronouncement makes it clear that women are not obliged to wear nikab - but rather this is a cultural issue within more conservative or radical interpretations of Islam just like the west has some Christian right wackies.	disgust	blog
13461	It most certainly raised even more anti-Muslim sentiment but also more anti-French sentiment even amongst it own non-Christian communities.	noemotion	blog
13462	Whether the French will ever admit it or not, they have a serious racism problem - and its aimed mainly at Muslims and Africans.	disgust	blog
13463	The Germans have passed similar laws, much to the dismay of its large Turkish-Muslim population.	disgust	blog
13464	The Brits, famous for their true melting pot status amongst the Europeans, have began treading in this murky water.	disgust	blog
13465	Jack Straw is calling for a ban of veils, or nikabs, in the UK.	noemotion	blog
13466	The well integrated, but edgy Muslim community is not so happy about this.	sadness	blog
13467	And I'm afraid it could get ugly.	fear	blog
13468	He clearly stated that he feels the veils should go -- but that it should be over a period of time and from within the Muslim community.	noemotion	blog
13469	It shouldn't, he added, be decided by a group of old white male politicians.	disgust	blog
13470	Not to mention that many Muslim women scholars are saying women should thank Jack Straw for this.	joy	blog
13471	What i do know is that there are many, many woman who absolutely voluntarily and willingly cover themselves with a headscarf for religious purposes.	noemotion	blog
13472	Most of the European peasantry covered themselves with a headscarf just a hundred years ago and can still be found in christian villages throughout eastern and southern europe.	noemotion	blog
13473	It is also true that many Muslim cultures in the world 'oblige' their women to wear the veil.	disgust	blog
13474	France says no head scarves, no nothing -- look like a sexy french school girl with your belly button hanging out.	noemotion	blog
13475	The Brits haven't ventured that far, they accept the head scarf, but oppose the ninja turtle look.	disgust	blog
13476	In its bid to become a secular society -- and to integrate into the unwelcoming arms of the European Union, it has forbidden even the nikab and in some places even the hijab in public schools and universities.	disgust	blog
13477	Sarajevo now has a large female Turkish population coming to study here so they can wear what they wish.	joy	blog
13478	It is Europe's largest 'indigenous' Muslim population, all of whom are white Europeans and embrace European principles.	noemotion	blog
13479	Bosnian Islam is very secular, and indeed seen by most European leaders as a model example of the type of Islam they want being taught in their increasing number of mosques and madressa's within the EU.	noemotion	blog
13480	The question of hijab and nikabs hasn't come up yet here in Bosnia.	noemotion	blog
13481	The progressive west is certainly faltering when it comes to questions of its growing Muslim populations and addressing the cultural and religious difference between east and west.	noemotion	blog
13482	The Muslims too have yet to seriously address the fears and concerns of 'indigenous' white westerners - who have opened their doors from some of the worlds worst economically and socially oppressed societies.	noemotion	blog
13483	The west must do more to grasp the concepts of Islam - and understand the vast cultural differences even with the large and diverse Muslim community, which covers three continents.	noemotion	blog
13484	Muslims too need to understand the fears and concerns of secular westerners who now have to deal with strict Islamic rules within their own communities.	noemotion	blog
13485	If western women can run around half naked, can eastern women completely cover themselves.	noemotion	blog
13486	Brother to brother, face to face, let's unite the human race.	noemotion	blog
13487	I'm EXTREMELY sad to say that it looks as though The Skyline Obscura will be on an indefinate hiatus as of this past Thursday.	sadness	blog
13488	Essentially, Christian is toggling with what direction, musically, he wants to pursue whether that be skyline or not, whereas in light of the confustion, I Mike have decided to leave the project.	other	blog
13489	It was not on any bad terms, and to be honest, I don't know if there still is a Skyline to speak of, but as those of you who know US know that I'm pretty focused and content with where I am heading, and I've definately got my own timetable in which I plan to do it.	anticipation	blog
13490	With that, some of the new songs that never were will be posted shortly for those of you who want to hear it.	noemotion	blog
13491	Sorry for the letdown, and I can't speak for everyone else, but I'd rather have this happen now than later.	sadness	blog
13492	Feel free to contact any of us individually about this if you feel so compelled as nobody's really going to be monitoring this site any more.	noemotion	blog
13493	You'll all receive notices of any Skyline updates and/or updates of new projects involving anyone from TSO past or pseudo-present.	noemotion	blog
13494	The one bad thing is that she got news this morning that her 21 y/o kitty, Aunt Becky, passed away last night.	sadness	blog
13495	She knew the kitty was not doing well she hasn't been for a while now, but kept rallying, so it wasn't a shock at all, but still sad.	sadness	blog
13496	She had been looking at having to have her PTS before she leaves for Africa, but I guess Aunt Becky had other ideas.	anticipation	blog
13497	I think Aunt Becky was waiting for my MIL to leave yesterday for her trip here.	noemotion	blog
13498	Aunt Becky was sent over the bridge in a traditional Anishinaabe Ojibwe/Chippewa ceremony.	noemotion	blog
13499	Aagii, my MIL's neighbor, is of the Bear Clan and is very traditional in her ways.	noemotion	blog
13500	She wrapped Aunt Becky in ceremonial cloth with 4 different herbs and buried her down by the creek that runs behind their homes in Topanga Canyon.	noemotion	blog
13501	My SIL and niece came over yesterday afternoon to collect our great-nephew, Brandon.	joy	blog
13502	He wanted B to stay at least for today so that he had a day off to play with him.	anticipation	blog
13503	They still are not sure what is going on with the transplanted kidney as it appears to be peeling like an onion, but his potassium and sugar and such are leveling out and he is feeling better.	anticipation	blog
13504	So last week was the Thanksgiving long weekend and it was sooo sweeeet.	joy	blog
13505	My sister came back from university and it was surprisingly nice to spend time with her again.	surprise	blog
13506	Anyways, on Monday I got to see some of my favourite people and that was really fun as well happy Go Augustine Inc..	joy	blog
13507	And I believe that God gave me this amazing opportunity for a specific reason and there's no way I'm turning it down.	joy	blog
13508	Please just pray for me and the trip and the other people who are going I'm not sure who yet so I shall keep it on the DL.	anticipation	blog
13509	I just feel like we're all getting caught in the whirlpool of life laughing what a funny term and I just wanted to urge you guys to not forget about checking up on each other.	trust	blog
13510	Besides from that random addition by my kooky self I hope you know what I'm trying to get at, because I know for me, that's how it is. I need you guys to help me through.	trust	blog
13511	First of all, I would like to say that I am proud of myself.	joy	blog
13512	What I completed in one day today, was not possible to me last week.	joy	blog
13513	Today, I can say I actually taught for all three of my periods.	joy	blog
13514	I walked into my first period only to find a sub.	surprise	blog
13515	I decided then and there that I would take advantage of the situation and teach the class.	anticipation	blog
13516	I figured I knew the material more than he did, and more importantly I knew the students and how the class should run.	surprise	blog
13517	I had them write in their journals for a few minutes, then proceeded to facilitate the day's assignments.	noemotion	blog
13518	This was a very short reading so I gave the class an assignment to go along with the reading.	noemotion	blog
13519	They had the remainder of the class to complete the assignment while I went around to monitor their work and answer questions.	noemotion	blog
13520	The period ran smoothly under my direction most suprisingly to me. I actually liked being thrown into the situation without having prior knowledge.	joy	blog
13521	On the other hand, I did know that today I was to teach a full period lesson to my freshmen for periods 3 6.	noemotion	blog
13522	For today's lesson I taught them how to determine the mood in a piece of literature based on the definition, an example, and a story out of their literature books.	noemotion	blog
13523	I began my lesson by explaining what the term mood meant.	noemotion	blog
13524	I explained to them that the mood of the story could be determined based on the word choice used by the author.	noemotion	blog
13525	To give them a better understanding of how mood works, I presented them with a paragraph that I wrote on the overhead.	noemotion	blog
13526	I had them follow along as I read out loud.	noemotion	blog
13527	After I was done reading my paragraph, I had the students tell me what was the mood I had created.	noemotion	blog
13528	Almost everyone participated, and for every type of mood they came up with, I had them point out places in the paragraph that helped them to determine the mood.	noemotion	blog
13529	I read the first paragraph, then I drew names out of my little tin container to complete the reading.	noemotion	blog
13530	After certain spots, I would have them go over plot summary just to make sure they were following along.	noemotion	blog
13531	I had them answer a question along the lines of, how would the mood of the story have been different if Soto wrote this as a child.	noemotion	blog
13532	They answered on their papers, then shared out as a class.	noemotion	blog
13533	This completed my very first lesson for periods 3 6.	noemotion	blog
13534	Wow, I hardly ever have plans.	surprise	blog
13535	I went to the OVAC volleyball tournament this morning, and was gone almost all day, and I'm going skating with one of my friends tonight.	noemotion	blog

13537	The libero is a defensive specialist and I have to keep track of who she goes in and out for.	noemotion	blog
13538	And the parents' club decided to pay for our breakfasts, so I got a free buffet.	joy	blog
13539	I tried to pay her back, but she wouldn't let me. So I got a free spiffin' sweet green tie-dyed OVAC shirt, too.	joy	blog
13540	I was gonna call my best friend and see if she wanted to go, but she wasn't there.	noemotion	blog
13541	We always try to get her to come, but it doesn't work.	sadness	blog

13583	One cop came, he talked to me for two seconds and then drove down the street a second.	noemotion	blog
13584	This time, unfortunately, he'd broken INTO the car already and was fishing things out.	sadness	blog
13585	I pick up my phone ON THE BALCONY and call the cops wihle I'm walking behind this joker.	anger	blog
13586	They sent SIX cop cars, two in each.	surprise	blog
13587	So 12 cops to investigate ONE car break in.	disgust	blog
13588	They all fly off in EVERY direction to find this kid of course, except the direction I said he went.	disgust	blog
13589	So basically I've met three new neighbors and we have like a community watch going on now.	noemotion	blog
13590	The cops spend more time driving down my road then they probably should.	disgust	blog
13591	But now I feel much happier and safer, and the neighbors all love me.  Did I mention it was after 2am every time the break-in occurred.	joy	blog
13592	They still love me, even though I woke them up at the butt-crack of dawn.	joy	blog
13593	=o  Although I feel like I've been on a really bad episode of 'Law and Order' now.	sadness	blog
13594	Afraid, confused, without a road map.	fear	blog
13595	Of course, when faced with the unknown many of us would turn around and run back.	fear	blog
13596	Something just beyond the pain of going on alone and just beyond the bravery and courage it takes to let someone in, or let them fade away.	sadness	blog
13597	Or to give someone a second chance.	noemotion	blog
13598	My worst fears have been personified.	fear	blog
13599	I only know that it could be anytime within the next 60 days.	anticipation	blog
13600	I don't even know for sure that it will happen, but with the way things have been going, I expect it to happen.	anticipation	blog
13601	There's nothing else I can say or do to change the situation.	noemotion	blog
13602	Woot I finally got an ipod with video 30g.	joy	blog
13603	Its kinda bad because I was feeling really sad/unhappy the day I baught it.	sadness	blog
13604	But I've been wanting it for like a year now, just never had the money, and never wanted to charge it.	anticipation	blog
13605	but oh I was a bad girl and put it on my best buy card.	joy	blog
13606	I got a black one, and oooh its so sexy.	joy	blog
13607	I got a leather case for it, but need to get some clear protective sheets for it too.	noemotion	blog
13608	Maybe a full case too, because the lil black pocket thing it came with is a little too snug, I have to force the lil bitch into it all the time.	anger	blog
13609	its not that much but hey its something.	joy	blog
13610	we had our first snowfall just the other day, the trees have gone to sleep and finally the walnuts have stopped falling on my garage roof and scaring me when i take my still lame dog out to take a shit before bed.	surprise	blog
13611	a lot of things have happened to me in the past six months, since the beginning of summer.	noemotion	blog
13612	three very dear friends of mine have lost very important people in their lives, and i have had to be the strong one they can lean on.	sadness	blog
13613	though i do not mind this one tiny bit it has been odd for me.  i'm rarely the strong one.	surprise	blog
13614	i am usually the one reduced to laying on the big green couch in the fetal position eating leftover pizza and crying about nothing and everything all at once.	sadness	blog
13615	turns out it has just made me question pretty much everything that i thought i knew.	surprise	blog
13616	now, i have no idea what i believe and what i want to do and how i want to spend the rest of my life.	sadness	blog
13617	we've been together since my sophomore year of college and had lived together for over a year in sin, mind you but i wasn't prepared for the change that would take place in our relationship.	surprise	blog
13618	i love him dearly and will forever, but i definately was not ready for that.	surprise	blog
13619	very disconnected to everyone and everything, not sure where to go from here.	sadness	blog
13620	but i don't want to admit that yet.	fear	blog
13621	another two words for you: john hughes.	noemotion	blog
13622	gotta milk those quarter-life crises for all they're worth.	disgust	blog
13623	want to get it done in time for the next snowfall.	anticipation	blog
13624	Have you ever made a decision and then later found out the consequences to that decision.	noemotion	blog
13625	I didn't mean to hurt this person at all.	sadness	blog
13626	I look ahead and I want to see me being a successful missionary/psychologist, married, with kids, and a great life.	anticipation	blog
13627	However, it seems the decisions I have been making are hindering that.	sadness	blog
13628	People everday get divorces, commit adultery and I don't want that.	disgust	blog
13629	I don't want to get hurt.	trust	blog
13630	*sighs*  I have a bad habit of hurting people before they can hurt me.  Like if I think that someone could and might hurt me then I hurt them first.	sadness	blog
13631	Then I think if I commit myself to this person only, what if I'm missing out on someone else.	fear	blog
13632	What if this isn't the right person for me and I'm making a huge mistake.	fear	blog
13633	But then I also think what if they are the right person.	other	blog
13634	Why is everything so confusing to me?   I'm trying to hear God right now, but maybe I'm not really listening.	sadness	blog
13635	I guess im just gonna have to be patient.	anticipation	blog
13636	I'll wait for God to show me what He wants me to do.	anticipation	blog
13637	So, keep praying for me that I'll be strong.	trust	blog
13638	I just have these moments when I start trying to do things without God and that never works.	noemotion	blog
13639	Anywayz, I'll ask God for His opinion.	noemotion	blog
13640	Welp today has been a long tiring day laughing out loud.	joy	blog
13641	I have been up most the night because the baby wouldn't go to sleep for nothing.	other	blog
13642	We lay him on our chest and he zonks out pretty fast and now hes so used to it he won't sleep in his crib or basinet so we have to find a way for him to sleep in the crib.	noemotion	blog
13643	Doctor says not to let them sleep on there belly for a while and thats the only way he sleeps good.	noemotion	blog
13644	I need a nap though I will tell you that laughing out loud.	joy	blog
13645	Oh well I know its something that comes along with having a baby laughing out loud.	joy	blog
13646	I will be glad when my mom gets here so we can go to wal-mart and then I can come back home and take a little nap.	joy	blog
13647	Anyways,tomorrow I guess my grandpa wants us to come over there so his brother than is in town to visit and everyone can see the baby.	noemotion	blog
13648	I am not to thrilled about going over there.	disgust	blog
13649	laughing out loud,and so we figgured we would just go to Six Flags.	joy	blog
13650	We could go out and I could watch him drink but he got a ticket and they have to mail his license to him and he has no ID yet.	noemotion	blog
13651	Our one year wedding anniversary, we had Landon this month,David's birthday today,other family members birthdays that are this month,halloween and tons of other stuff laughing out loud.	joy	blog
13652	I still need to do laundry later and I need to do the dishes and then maybe just maybe I will get to lay down for a bit before he wakes upEhh prolly not laughing out loud Oh and for everyone that wants to see the baby if there is not a nice day coming up you may have to come to my house because its to cold for us to be taking him out in this weather,I don't need a sick baby along with my hundred other problems laughing out loud,that or you can come visit when we are over at my grandpas,other than that your s.o.l on seeing my lil stud muffin laughing out loud.	noemotion	blog
13653	Almost sounds like an EMO song title.	noemotion	blog
13654	I am once again becoming an OT whore, which was originally to buy myself a new gun Springfiled XD40 3 Subcompact.	anticipation	blog
13655	But, with pay days in Oct. being where they are, and bills due on the dates they're due, that idea is totally shot for now.	sadness	blog
13656	The OT whoring now is to make enough to pay bills on time, not to buy new and fun things.	disgust	blog
13657	I'm also working at the YMCA every Monday in October, which helps, but makes me tired as all get out.	noemotion	blog
13658	Nothing big to report, except that every time I volunteer to do a full 8 hours of OT after my normal shift, I find myself going home 2-4 hours into it due to them over-hiring and not realizing it.	disgust	blog
13659	I have a new pic of Melissa and I, which I will post shortly.	joy	blog
13660	We just celebrated 3 great months on the 8th, and last night we carved pumpkins she brought me a pumpkin, it was pretty sweet.	joy	blog
13661	Bagpiping got moved to one of our together nights, so that puts a small damper on the time we see each other for every week.	sadness	blog
13662	I joined a gun club the other night.	noemotion	blog
13663	Membership is only $50/year and a $50 initiation fee.	noemotion	blog
13664	The shooting is unlimited for the most part between 8a and 10p.	noemotion	blog
13665	This is good for the odd hour shooter like me. Also, there is a 25 yd outdoor range, which accepts a variety of loads shotgun, magnum, etc.	joy	blog
13666	The indoor range has 8 lanes, but is only 15 yards long.	noemotion	blog
13667	The best part is, I shoot pretty well there, and the lighting is really good.	joy	blog
13668	If anyone is interested, it's the Phillipsburg Pistol Club, and can be found on the web just google it's name.	noemotion	blog
13669	Reawaken is taking allot of my time this week inspite of my heavy harvest schedule on the farm.	joy	blog
13670	We are starting to get some interesting inquiries.	joy	blog
13671	I made contact with various Pentagon types who deal specifically with the USO and stand down concerts on a variety of military installations in California.	noemotion	blog
13672	Also since I belong to a variety of social organizations it was easy to make concert contacts through them.	noemotion	blog
13673	Who knows where we will be playing in 2007.	noemotion	blog
13674	I have my eyes on a few locations like Kwajalein RMI and Soto Cano-Honduras; with friends in low places we'll probably get those gigs.	anticipation	blog
13675	In the mean time we have a huge private party in April booked and the Mateel Arts and Music Festival for June as well.	anticipation	blog
13676	The list of folks who want a copy of the CD-First Light is being built up one name at a time.	anticipation	blog
13677	Anyone who wants one I will send one.	noemotion	blog
13678	I may just have the band members do a strip for old ladies at the senior clubs if we have open dates unfilled.	noemotion	blog
13679	Leaving for Irvine on the 18th for Maiden.	anticipation	blog
13680	See you mates up front of Arrys monitor.	anticipation	blog
13681	I was cleaning up Kristen Ward's apartment when a beer spilled all over my socks and pants and I don't even care.	noemotion	blog
13682	Like thousands of people poured into the street last night for excitement.	joy	blog
13683	Lots of people used drugs and drank beer.	noemotion	blog
13684	Tonight is also the drag show which I shall be attending faithfully.	anticipation	blog
13685	Last night I had a long discussion at 4:30am about xanax addiction and molestation.	noemotion	blog
13686	Hard alcohol would surely have put me in the ER.	fear	blog
13687	your hair looks like shit Mary.	disgust	blog
13688	She has 4 boys staying her who attend West Point.	noemotion	blog
13689	Everyone is gone and I just cleaned up, so now I'm going to loosen up my buttons, take a long hot shower, put on my clothing and my adorable pea coat, and make my way downtown.	joy	blog
13690	And I still rule this town, I'm just a little more mature, a little more with it.	joy	blog
13691	Look at me!  I'm like Ellen on straight television.	joy	blog
13692	I met this 'straight' boy at the gay bar last night.	disgust	blog
13693	I feel like I should be writting right now.	other	blog
13694	I suppose there was the time that Dread, named not for the feeling one gets when thinking about the smell which followed him, but rather for his haircut, came by while my mother was there and pulled bacon out of his pocket, and then his other pocket, and then from under his shirt, then from his pants.	noemotion	blog
13695	Within a week I bid on and won about 14 cookie jars.	joy	blog
13696	They are just so cute I can't resist them although I think I am under control now.	joy	blog
13697	The lady at the post office is starting to laugh at me.  Where am I going to put them all.	anticipation	blog
13698	I have only had one bad experience on Ebay so far.	sadness	blog
13699	I emailed the seller and told him about it and he was very arrogant and rude.	anger	blog
13700	To make a long story short, he told me I must have wanted this ugly old hen to match my personality.	anger	blog
13701	I told him he was a f----ing a--hole and gave him a negative rating.	anger	blog
13702	He in turn gave me a negative rating.	sadness	blog
13703	And because I am such a perfectionist the negative rating had me bummed for awhile but now I am better.	sadness	blog
13704	I sold an electric blanket for more than I paid for it.	noemotion	blog
13705	I see Frankie at the junkyard has several electric blankets.	noemotion	blog
13706	I can probably pick them up for less than a buck and sell them for lots lots more as long as they work.	anticipation	blog
13707	We have been staying pretty close to home but still having a good time.	joy	blog
13708	It has finally cooled down a bit which is a big relief.	joy	blog
13709	I love my nap and story time with BooBoo every afternoon.	joy	blog
13710	That means I recline on the couch with a good book after lunch and BooBoo my cat is always stretched out on my lap.	joy	blog
13711	Tim is working on putting a border fence up in the front of the property.	noemotion	blog
13712	Then he wants to put in an underground sprinkler system before we plant grass in front.	noemotion	blog
13713	We also will be planting trees and shrubs in front and some day putting a small deck coming out of the front door.	noemotion	blog
13714	It just all takes time and money.	noemotion	blog
13715	We have come a long way in a year though.	joy	blog
13716	Today I also made a devils food bundt cake with chocolate chip glaze.	noemotion	blog
13717	With all this cheese we will probably be constipated tomorrow.	disgust	blog
13718	Oh shit, day by day update.	disgust	blog
13719	So, I love 4 day weeks of school, I really do.	joy	blog
13720	Then later hung out with some loser until like 12.	disgust	blog
13721	Then Ashlie and Becky came and picked me up, we stopped at Joey's to see if they had any applications, then went out to the mall so I could turn in some apps, and so Ashlie could buy some underwears.	noemotion	blog
13722	First off, it's a hike to get up to this place, and I can't see worth shit in the dark.	disgust	blog
13723	We were up there for awhile and Idk why or how, but Ryan pushed me off of this bench and I fell flat on my back scraping my hip up, which hurts ha.	sadness	blog
13724	Then they were cutting this damn tree down, and they made me go with then by dragging me over since I didn't want to go, and when I tried to sneak away.	anger	blog
13725	I guess I walked behind Ryan right when he swung this huge ass AXE and he swung it right into my face.	surprise	blog
13726	Not only all that, I ended up calling Aubrey, and ending up balling like a baby, because I really do miss her and everything we used to have.	sadness	blog
13727	Even after getting off the phone with her, I balled forever.	sadness	blog
13728	It was sooo cold out, seeing as I don't have a winter jacket or anything.	noemotion	blog
13729	Plus, I didn't eat anything at all yesterday, and I ended up getting really sick.	sadness	blog
13730	It was real lame.	disgust	blog
13731	Ehh Other than that it was a good time.	joy	blog
13732	Today, Chels made me a sandwhich since she loves me, and I had some soup so I feel better.	joy	blog
13733	I'm going out for a little tonight, and then I'm gonna see if Ash and Beck want to stay.	anticipation	blog
13734	It all started a month ago in kickboxing class at least that part sounds way cool.	noemotion	blog
13735	The new instructor is a former marine and showed us these five-pointed-star push-ups.	noemotion	blog
13736	Yeah, I know, right up there with Custer laughing off a few measly Indians.	disgust	blog
13737	Anyway, I get home and notice my knee feels kinda tight.	surprise	blog
13738	Okay, no problem, I'll just tone down my workouts until I'm back at 100%.	noemotion	blog
13739	So I figure I'll just check in with my G.P., get a nice cortisone shot in the knee and I'm good to go.	anticipation	blog
13740	But my beloved G.P., who usually just prescribes stuff for me over the phone, starts throwing around words like orthopedic, surgery, and x-rays and I start thinking, oh shit.	fear	blog
13741	Of course once he says the magic words degenerative arthritis and not uncommon AT MY AGE I do a total brain freeze and hear pretty much nothing afterwards.	fear	blog
13742	So what's a girl to do to cheer herself up.	sadness	blog
13743	So I'm old, but I have these really cute Etienne Aigner boots to show for it.	joy	blog
13744	My gene pool used to lie before me like a pretty lake and I rarely gave it much thought.	noemotion	blog
13745	I'm not going to grow old gracefully.	fear	blog
13746	Seen from a distance, I've been following the script,.	noemotion	blog
13747	the path that society lays down for people like me.	noemotion	blog
13748	the times I have felt most free, most alive,.	joy	blog
13749	the times we have been at our best, have shone brightest,.	joy	blog
13750	skipped a line or a page or an act;.	noemotion	blog
13751	or just set fire to the whole thing and made it up as we've gone along.	noemotion	blog
13752	I will not play the part that others have chosen for me.	anger	blog
13753	Sucks for Levon but he said he wouldn't let me drive with the trailer anyways.	anger	blog
13754	Plus, this means I can get my drivers license in AZ which means it will be good for 65 years.	anticipation	blog
13755	I know I can drive that's not my problem I just need to study more for the written.	noemotion	blog
13756	I'll try to call but I have work all weekend then monday I'm going to NY.	anticipation	blog
13757	Everybody call me. Just letting you all know I suck at at tests.	disgust	blog
13758	first: heh heh  heh, so appropriate fer me.	joy	blog
13759	couldn't the fucking terrorists decide to get caught, you know, after i landed.	anger	blog
13760	they had to be stupid terrorists and think in their fundementalist clouded minds that they'd change the world.	disgust	blog
13761	or convert everyone to Islam, or just blow you up one by one in a fucking plane, train, or automobile.	anger	blog
13762	let me calculate how long that'll take with current rates of reproduction and the current world population.	noemotion	blog
13763	so far, all you've done is to cause international travellers the annoyance of having to hand over their toothpaste and make sure their baby's formula isn't nitroglycerin by drinking some.	anger	blog
13764	you've killed less people in the last six years than we did to ourselves in a week in 1916.	disgust	blog
13765	if you read history instead of fucking dogma all the god damn time you'd realize we're perfectly capable of raining destruction upon ourselves in a very effective manner, thank you very much.	anger	blog
13766	how about you ignore us, we'll ignore you, you all can go to heaven and we can all be infidels and suffer through our evil.	anger	blog
13767	what do you care if all ours are all bad.	noemotion	blog
13768	i'm being a little flippant here, but i'm sure you get the point.	noemotion	blog
13769	which is worse than pissing us off.	anger	blog
13770	because when you piss us off, we have to used measured restraint.	anger	blog
13771	when you annoy us long enough NO ONE WILL CARE ABOUT RESTRAINT.	anger	blog
13772	we'll just let our governments do whatever the fuck they want because we want to brush our fucking teeth on a plane after some really bad airplane food.	anger	blog
13773	never underestimate the power of wide spread apathy and annoyance.	disgust	blog
13774	i am a rational, intelligent, rather well informed individual.	noemotion	blog
13775	in nine days i will spend probably 5-6 hours in aiports, whereas, 10 years ago.	noemotion	blog
13776	why must i show up three hours early for my flight.	disgust	blog
13777	its your fault, it really is.  so when i'm standing in line, or waiting around, i'll be thinking of you.	anger	blog
13778	trying to keep my rational and logical mind from straying to bad thoughts about how stupid the human race is and how religion is nothing but trouble.	disgust	blog
13779	and try and sympathize with those being racially profiled ahead of me and making for an even longer wait in line.	disgust	blog
13780	The job was frustrating today.	anger	blog
13781	I look up the address he mumbles to me and see that no payment has come in for 5 months.	noemotion	blog
13782	Then they throw a little hissy fit for 5 minutes as I repeat myself over and over.	disgust	blog
13783	And then I get an equally obnoxious call.	disgust	blog
13784	Or some woman will call with a question that has nothing to do with circulation.	disgust	blog
13785	This happened an unhealthy amount today.	disgust	blog
13786	And originally I was supposed to be given some book of all knowledge.	noemotion	blog
13787	And then the dispatcher was all pissy with me over some redelivery shenanigans I was doing wrong.	anger	blog
13788	Talking about running into ongoing traffic and killing himself, and doing weed.	sadness	blog
13789	Sheldon and I told him to shut up.	anger	blog
13790	He got up and said he doesn't have to take this from us and was especially angry at me. I was a mega bitch to him.	anger	blog
13791	He was so good-looking.	joy	blog
13792	Words like that made me and Phil stop smiling, look straight at Sheldon, and say shut up at the same time.	anger	blog
13793	A couple of times Sheldon would say things to him and he would get angry and tell him to shut up.	anger	blog
13794	He didn't want to make eye contact with me, but we made eye contact a lot.	noemotion	blog
13795	It was brief, and every single time, we would smile.	joy	blog
13796	The whole way there he was grabbing onto poles and screaming like a banshee and his friend Johnny who came along got a swift punch in the nuts from Phil.	noemotion	blog
13797	I asked Phil, what the hell are you doing? and he looked angrily at me. Like I did anything wrong.	anger	blog
13798	Then when we were there, I got what I needed, as did they, and I was standing outside with Phil as the other two were still in there.	noemotion	blog
13799	I started talking to him about why he was so mad, and he said you called me retarded, and I explained that he was being a prick.	anger	blog
13800	And he said that since he started drugs, he's a prick.	anger	blog
13801	I told him he didn't lose me, and he just looked at me and didn't say a word.	joy	blog
13802	They followed, but Daniel took two minutes to look back at me. I was angry.	anger	blog
13803	My facial expression was beyond hurt.	sadness	blog
13804	I know I shouldn't have been snotty about it but I thought it was fucking obvious.	anger	blog
13805	I called home to as my mom for a ride but she said she was busy, I WAS NEAR CRYING AND SHE WAS BUSY.	sadness	blog
13806	I hung up and started walking home.	sadness	blog
13807	Like 10 minutes into walking home aaron pulled up to drive me home.	noemotion	blog
13808	I never even told him what happened, but he helped, a lot.	joy	blog
13809	the trip was fantastic, plimoth was old and there were real live pilgrims everywhere, salem was cute and adorable but very touristy, ithaca was gorgeous and adorable and joel was there so the whole thing made me very happy and clearly that was the highlight of the trip, niagara was fantastically beautiful but boring once you've seen the falls, buffalo was sketchy but had great wings and now im home, and i think it's the most wonderful place ive ever been and i dont ever want to leave.	joy	blog
13810	well, give me two weeks and i'll be out of here but for now, it's good.	anticipation	blog
13811	it was wonderful to be away from home but it is indeed wonderful to be back.	joy	blog
13812	i thought a lot about different things and i wrote more than i have in a long, long time.	noemotion	blog
13813	i felt particularly inspired a few hours after we left ithaca becos i had finally finished stone garden and reading that book always sends me into great fits of creation.	joy	blog
13814	maybe i'll share some day, and maybe i wont.	noemotion	blog
13815	the only thing im sure of at this moment in time is that life is beautiful and i am just so satisfied and so content.	joy	blog
13816	but for now im going to go experience how fabulous the night sky smells.	joy	blog
13817	Work is going well I suppose, most people are nice and I've been warned of which ones are better to avoid.	joy	blog
13818	My hours are/were gradually going up, after tomorrow I'll have had 23 this week, but next week is only 11, and five days off is a bit much.	sadness	blog
13819	They're starting to put me in other parts of the store, which is kind of nifty.	joy	blog
13820	I've been having random fears and doubts lately, but that happens.	fear	blog
13821	I suppose there's been a fair amount of drama, including some with my ex Sadie.	sadness	blog
13822	Then again, I guess that's how it was last time.	noemotion	blog
13823	I have work in the morning, then three days off.	joy	blog
13824	Today at work, I was working on a job that was supposed to print as three colors, black, spot red and spot silver, but the background image the client provided was CMYK, with the spot colors built in that color space, including gradations of them.	noemotion	blog
13825	But I, with my mad Photoshop skills, was able to convert it to the corect color space while faithfully maintaining the appearence and detail of the image, including the gradations.	joy	blog
13826	I'm the man.	noemotion	blog
13827	P.S. If you don't understand exactly what I did it's a bit technical, just know that it was impressive and I rock.	joy	blog
13828	P.P.S. When I say that you might not understand because it's technical, I'm not trying to brag, it's just kind of specialized in the same way I don't understand when people talk about car repair or finance.	noemotion	blog
13829	So I spent the day watching The Real World: Austin, with my little brother.	noemotion	blog
13830	We decided we'd watch as much episodes as possible and also made a promise none of us would use the computer.	anticipation	blog
13831	But anyway, so we watched tv during the morning and when 4pm came by, we decided to do laundry and play Burnout 3; I beat his ass.	joy	blog
13832	I guess today was somewhat fun, considering I spent the day with my younger brother.	joy	blog
13833	But other than that, I feel really alone right now because it's Friday and I'm home.	sadness	blog
13834	I haven't really been going out much and it just makes me mad since I told myself this summer I'd make the best of it since I'd be going to university in September.	anger	blog
13835	Gosh, in exactly one month school's going to start and boy am I nervous.	fear	blog
13836	these are the words the senior VP of Telecommunications told us on Tuesday.	noemotion	blog
13837	Congratulations- and Welcome to Corporate America- where the Vice Presidents and Senior Officers and Managers don't hibernate-- they walk among you.	joy	blog
13838	I have a 99 average in my class.	joy	blog
13839	When your Trainer comes into the room all smiles after lunch and announces that she moved up ONE level- From ABT Trainer 1 to ABT Trainer 2 and got a $10,000 salary increase.	joy	blog
13840	It makes me sick that my trainer is 24.	disgust	blog
13841	That means if I stay on the right path- when I'm 25 I could be an ABT Trainer 2 as well- or the equivalent.	anticipation	blog
13842	I could be an IT Specialist V in 4 years.	anticipation	blog
13843	The advancement opportunities are just awesome.	joy	blog
13844	Spend 1 year answering calls for the Claims spread- and then be free to go to where-ever your heart desires.	anticipation	blog
13845	I've been staying at Mary's house and she keeps telling me I'd be an awesome mommy.	joy	blog
13846	I see everyday just how much good that company does.	joy	blog
13847	They raised over $200,000.00 for Cancer Research with a BASEBALL GAME.	joy	blog
13848	The AFLAC All-American Baseball Classic.	noemotion	blog
13849	I monitored calls today with Julia.	noemotion	blog
13850	She never once had a caller that she didn't make laugh- at least once during their call.	joy	blog
13851	That old quote comes back to me- the origin has slipped my mind, but we are the movers and the shakers and the dreamers of dreams.	other	blog
13852	I'm still working on that family part.	noemotion	blog
13853	but I've not talked to the most important person in my life- in over a week.	sadness	blog
13854	and it's killing me.	sadness	blog
13855	I'm starting to fray at the ends- the next step is to break- somethings gotta give and I'm pulling with all my might to keep everything together.	fear	blog
13856	But even superman has his kryptonite.	noemotion	blog
13857	I'm tired of broken promises- and empty dreams.	disgust	blog
13858	Or he would've come through last weekend.	noemotion	blog
13859	The thread to this relationship is wearing thin- it's on it's last strand- and though he may think it's cool to not do what he says hes going to- it's not cool to me.	disgust	blog
13860	The worst part is- I love him.	sadness	blog
13861	I love him with every ounce of everything that I am- but try as I might- we just cant' get it together.	sadness	blog
13862	We're still together- and we still have the opportunity to make things right - - - but I'm a very patient person- and it's been close to 5 years now- and my patience is wearing thin.	disgust	blog
13863	Something has to happen SOON.	anticipation	blog
13864	I would like to be married before I'm 23.	anticipation	blog
13865	Yes, we are having a small celebration today.	joy	blog
13866	I am always so happy after talking to him.	joy	blog
13867	Anyway, he said that since he and all of the troop are having to stay 16 months, they are getting to come home for 5 whole days for leave after they are done with their training and before they go to thier permanent post.	anticipation	blog
13868	So they thought they were going for 12 and Wayne thought he was going for 10 and then one day BOOM they are staying for 16.	noemotion	blog
13869	And every sigle one of them are furious.	anger	blog
13870	Wayne says that the tension is unreal.	anticipation	blog
13871	So they are getting to come home for a short time after thier training.	anticipation	blog
13872	I will get that 5 days and then later on he will still get RnR.	anticipation	blog
13873	That was the first thing that I thought will that cut down yalls RnR? and he said no.	noemotion	blog
13874	It is just something they get to do because they are having to go longer than intended or however they word that.	noemotion	blog
13875	I told her that she better get on the ball and she looked at me and yawned so maybe that was a yes, laughing out loud.	joy	blog
13876	If not I may have to get her a shot to induce labor.	anticipation	blog
13877	That was one of the first things that Wayne wanted to know hows alley, has she had the pups I think he loves those dogs as much as me! I'll never forget the first tail that he docked by himself it was Tuff's tail.	joy	blog
13878	I was so proud.	joy	blog
13879	He had watched me dock two litters but still he did a great job.	joy	blog
13880	Now, he wishes that he was here to help with this litter Image.	sadness	blog
13881	But I am still SOOOOO excited that I'll get to see him for 5 days.	anticipation	blog
13882	It is yet another Accounting class so everyone wish me luck.	anticipation	blog
13883	I love Poodie's site is so inspiring.	joy	blog
13884	I feel very uninspiring.	sadness	blog
13885	I am going to give it a try and I apologize if it's boring or ugly.	anticipation	blog
13886	I can't decide if I want to pay the fee to make it a fancy blog.	noemotion	blog
13887	He is laying like a bum on the couch watching CSI:NY.	disgust	blog
13888	I am sure he is going to force Baby Huff to watch it and learn all it's moral lessons from that show vs. meetings.	anticipation	blog
13889	OH OH OH  he is yelling at me, Are you ready to go, already.	fear	blog
13890	Like it's me holding up the show.	disgust	blog
13891	Three people have been laid off at the office in the past hour.	sadness	blog
13892	When I come back from my Survival course and return to work, I won't have a staff anymore.	sadness	blog
13893	They will be fine eventually but deserve better than one week's notice.	disgust	blog
13894	I'll miss them and can't say goodbye properly now.	sadness	blog
13895	I will have to plan an agency party/reunion at the end of August.	noemotion	blog
13896	NOW I'm ready to get away to the rattlesnakes and scorpions.	anticipation	blog
13897	I have little news - just about two weeks left on the job and ihere in p-town so gimme a call before the 25th.	noemotion	blog
13898	I'm excited to move in.	anticipation	blog

13912	She was just a pain in the ASS yeeah, sucks to be her.	disgust	blog

13914	It was the School dance  I had to work in one of the door entrance.	noemotion	blog

13916	Dancing, ASB, dancing, ASB back forth.	joy	blog
13917	I never really noticed it but Natalie, Ryan, Christan Leslie are fun to be around with.	joy	blog
13918	Friday was even more fun [: I ended my day in the ASB yeah.	joy	blog
13919	I know im talking about the ASB alot but that`s pretty much whats been happening.	noemotion	blog
13920	My two fingers that I tie the ballons with were smelled like balloons.	noemotion	blog
13921	She had all these cool stuff I wanna take, hahah.	joy	blog

13924	Saw some Otay people then headed to Veterans park after.	noemotion	blog
13925	Saw Aldrin his friends so I guess we hung out ? Jason them left early.	noemotion	blog
13926	Hung upside down like monkeys at the monkey bars acted like little kids at the swing once again.	noemotion	blog
13927	Sucks I didn't bring my camera but yeeah.	sadness	blog
13928	I think tomorrow a friend`s coming over ? Not sure who, haha kaay bye.	surprise	blog
13929	I must say this summer has gone by in the blink of an eye.	sadness	blog
13930	what seemed like 4 months off, has seemed like it at all.	noemotion	blog
13931	So far I have done zip camping, no trips to the lake.	noemotion	blog
13932	I have been quite preoccupied though so I can't blame my lack of summer fun on laziness.	noemotion	blog
13933	I  am getting so tired of this studying for my securities exam.	sadness	blog
13934	just once I would love to not have to worry about that sort of thing.	fear	blog
13935	and to have more than 2 weeks of vacation time.	noemotion	blog
13936	but this is life and we must not forget that like is not a holiday.	sadness	blog
13937	I go for my practicum interview next week along with a 2 day orientation at PI.	anticipation	blog
13938	At least that is one issue that has finally gotten rolliing.	joy	blog
13939	I was beginning to worry I'de have to put it off for yet another term.	fear	blog
13940	I haven't really given school much thought as of recent times.	noemotion	blog
13941	I started with one dream, and was working towards it, now I don't see it anymore.	sadness	blog
13942	hey I'll be a rich individual.	anticipation	blog
13943	I'm really in it just for the money ;.	noemotion	blog
13944	actually I just want to give the opportunity a chance.	trust	blog
13945	I still will have my degree to back me up and I true desire to go into law enforcement, but for now I want to do this.	anticipation	blog
13946	it  gets me out of the job I'm in and will open the doors to other opportunities that aren't available to me now.	anticipation	blog
13947	Maybe I have become lazy in thought b/c I don't bother with it.	disgust	blog
13948	Worry gains you no more minutes to  your life.	noemotion	blog
13949	rather it steals what precious ones you have left.	anger	blog
13950	we have no one to blame but our selves.	sadness	blog
13951	society has become just one big stress pool.	disgust	blog
13952	Our conversations with family, friends, co-workers etc., all seem to revolve around how crappy are day is, has been, or is going to be, and it seems all like we compete with one another to see who has a crappier one.	disgust	blog
13953	where I am going with this I have no clue.	noemotion	blog
13954	I don't have a plan, I don't know what I want in the long run.	fear	blog
13955	I love my family unconditionally, and cherish every moment with them, even my eldest sister, who pushes me over the edge, but I have developed a certain method inwhich to deal with it.	trust	blog
13956	I have to look at life in her perspective, and it would break anyones heart.	sadness	blog
13957	To have something inside of you that you cannot control, something foreign that has stolen away your chance of a normal life.	sadness	blog
13958	being alienated, being alone.	sadness	blog
13959	I can only take so much of her though, for her sake and mine happy.	disgust	blog
13960	I have a job where I have come to know some amazing people who have such potential, but possibly will never get to put it to any use due to the cirumstances of the choices in life.	sadness	blog
13961	but they make my time at work memorable.	joy	blog
13962	I have put my life in the hands of god, and left him to it.	trust	blog
13963	I am happy with a casual, not serious, no pressure relationship.	joy	blog
13964	I frankly would be just as happy alone.	sadness	blog
13965	Still there is so much more to learn, and my life is but young.	anticipation	blog
13966	I have a list of things I want to do during my time, and each day I add something new to it.	anticipation	blog
13967	laughing out loud, lets just hope I don't run out of time to complete it.	joy	blog
13968	anyway I heard this while I was in church and it really grabbed my interest.	anticipation	blog
13969	A few days ago, I ran into this article online: http://msnbc.msn.com/id/14126192/ talking about statistics regarding the number of friends people having being at some sort of new low.	surprise	blog
13970	I guess I fit the group the article refers to, in regards to having only 2 or 3 friends that would fall into the support mechanism category, if only because of circumstantial or geographical factors being taken into consideration as well.	noemotion	blog
13971	One of those 3 will be moving this fall, and the others have an awful lot going on in their lives, in addition to being less available than the first by a long shot anyhow.	noemotion	blog
13972	On a larger scale, this really makes me think about the way that I've cultivated my friendships, and the way I've maintained them as well.	trust	blog
13973	I definitely feel like, moreso than any other time in my life, I'm operating almost at the ground floor in regards to the friendships I have and the way I interact with those friends.	sadness	blog
13974	I've burned a lot of bridges and engaged in decisions which have hampered my ability to be trusted as much as I'd like to be by some of my friends, and likewise, there have been things which have altered my ability to fully engage some people as well, be they circumstacial or environmental or whatever.	sadness	blog
13975	Suffice to say that there are a fair amount of people out there whom I would count among my friends, but limited few whom I would count as good friends, due to actions both inside and outside of my role in that friendship.	sadness	blog
13976	We're getting older, we have a lot more work-related matters and our personal lives can get pretty complicated.	sadness	blog
13977	You build friendships as fortifications against getting too old too fast, but sometimes life just catches up with you regardless of your efforts.	sadness	blog
13978	On a big picture scale, I'd like to believe that I still hold the same value system that I held when I was 18 years old, now a scary half-a-lifetime ago.	sadness	blog
13979	All in all, I'm satisfied with the bigger picture and angry as fuck at the smaller details, but that's what keeps you going, isn't it.	anger	blog
13980	As far as support mechanisms go, I've seen what they do to people- at their best, they act as a bridge to help people reach things both within and outside themself that they may not have been previously able to reach.	joy	blog
13981	Home may be where you hang your hat, but happiness is sometimes found far from home or in the last place you'd even expect to look for it.	surprise	blog
13982	I think sometimes it can be easy to lose track of the idea that happiness and comfort are two completely separate entities and having one does not guarantee or equal having the other some of the time, at least.	noemotion	blog
13983	It goes back to that whole journey vs. destination idea, in that some people only mark success by arriving at a goal, while others are capable of enjoying the efforts required to reach that goal as well.	noemotion	blog
13984	if the goals are similar, which one would you prefer to be.	noemotion	blog
13985	Friendship works the same way- some people only appreciate friendships which are productive and goal-oriented, whereas there are also friendships that meander along the way, and each moment can be as interesting and rewarding as the ones before and after.	trust	blog
13986	It can be really difficult to appreciate just what a friendship really means to you, especially when it's something you can take for granted fairly easily if you aren't careful.	noemotion	blog
13987	I know I'm guilty of that all the time.	noemotion	blog
13988	Often we fail to realize what we've lost until something becomes too distant and difficult to regain.	sadness	blog
13989	Old wounds fester into something that can't be healed, neglect becomes forgetfulness which then becomes amnesia, and before long you wonder if it ever happened.	sadness	blog
13990	It sucks, and it takes effort to keep a swerving friendship from heading down these sort of paths, but the effort far outweighs the consequences of failing to do so.	disgust	blog
13991	It means I have some tough choices to make.	anticipation	blog
13992	I can only change my own mind, so whatever efforts I expend have to be met with some sort of equal efforts or the process goes nowhere and frustrates me the entire way.	anger	blog
13993	Is it worth it, or is it better to just let fate play out its' hand and look for a new deal.	noemotion	blog
13994	There's usually no way to know until it's too late regardless.	surprise	blog
13995	I guess I do what I can to make the most of what I have, if it's not enough then it likely never was, and in that case, at least I know I tried.	noemotion	blog
13996	If being a friend isn't about trying, then I've been taking the wrong approach all along.	sadness	blog
13997	As of late, it seems that everything my parents do, they do it just to annoy me. They're great parents.	anger	blog
13998	I'm not going to go into specifics here, but it almost always ends up in yelling and tears.	anger	blog
13999	I was thinking about our most recent spat today at dinner and wondering why the hell everything turns out this way.	sadness	blog
14000	My only plausible explanation is that I want out.	anger	blog
14001	No matter how much I love them, I want to be independent and living on my own, providing for myself and on the road to success.	anticipation	blog
14002	Now, I know that I will reach this place soon enough, but damn it feels like it is taking forever.	anger	blog
14003	I know its normal for someone who's in college to be living with their parents, but that doesn't quell the wish to be independent and free.	noemotion	blog
14004	Now me and Tyler are running the shop and I don't know if Tyler's even going to stay or not.	fear	blog
14005	Lots of angry costomers with half finished work, a boss who pays for the furniture but has no idea how to run a business.	disgust	blog
14006	My gun, my nozzles, my power supply, my footpedal.	noemotion	blog
14007	It's been a week and I'm still really pissed off.	anger	blog
14008	I have been TRYING to post for three days, but bloody Spaces was having issues errors on pages and I couldn't do it - my Wanker Boss post was due to be posted on Thursday.	noemotion	blog
14009	Further to that by the way, I did speak to him about it further when he said My new food is making me feel really healthy - yes considering he'd eated two meals of it, and then gone out to dinner, and Friday was going out to lunch with a friend.	disgust	blog
14010	He's paying $250 a week to eat food, and then eat again.	disgust	blog
14011	But I asked him about WHY he doesn't cook for himself, and he said he just doesn't have enough time.	noemotion	blog
14012	The look on my face I think said it all.	noemotion	blog
14013	This is the man who gets into the office at 10:30am, leaves by 3pm, takes 20minutes to get to the office, dry cleans all his clothes, has a cleaner, doesn't have a wife or family to chase after - and he doesn't have time?I explained that I travel 1.5 hours each way, every day to go to work, I go to the gym more than he does, I cook my meals, I have a life, and I have a house to look after.	disgust	blog
14014	I choose to do more important things with my time.	noemotion	blog
14015	Let me see - golf, sitting on a beach drinking coffee, bitching about money, being a complete elitest snob.	disgust	blog
14016	great life choices right there.	joy	blog
14017	no wonder he doesn't have a girlfrend if his definition of more important things than actually looking after yourself like an adult isn't important enough.	disgust	blog
14018	I think though, what pisses me most off about the food delivery issue - is that he has chosen the easy I don't have to do anything option.	anger	blog
14019	If I could afford the food, I would probably do it myself, but Jenny Craig was expensive enough, and that was $100 a week, not $250, and I didn't have a mortgage then.	noemotion	blog
14020	But since he has chosen this option, it's just really irritating me, because he has no concept of a weight problem - he just is lazy.	disgust	blog
14021	He could EASILY cook his own food - his kitchen probably cost more than half my house.	disgust	blog
14022	Sorry for the ranting post, but I'm just really annoyed that here I am, struggling with all my internal demons about my weight loss, and someone like this, with no concept of struggle, can just pay someone to lose it for him.	anger	blog
14023	She slams on her brakes, stops her car, right in front of me, in the middle of the street, and gets out.	fear	blog
14024	Then she comes up to me and starts yelling at me.	anger	blog
14025	YOU LIKE ALMOST HIT ME OMG. she said, tossing her dyed blonde hair like an enraged horse, nostrils flaring.	anger	blog
14026	I'm not very nice, not when facing death.	fear	blog
14027	OMFG if there is like damage.	noemotion	blog
14028	 She threatened.	fear	blog
14029	I must admit, I was kind of fascinated by the way her eyes, rimmed in black eyeliner, managed to stay so wide open like that.	surprise	blog
14030	Finally I got fed up.	disgust	blog
14031	THis was when the Princess turned into some sort of psychobitch from hell.	anticipation	blog
14032	Now, people are already honking and stuff because her daddy's lexus is blocking the intersection.	anger	blog
14033	I got mad.	anger	blog
14034	Now, when one says you, hit like a girl take it as a compliment.	joy	blog
14035	I hit that bitch so hard.	anger	blog
14036	hey, she assulted me. in the middle of an intersection.	anger	blog
14037	and I was on a fucking BIKE.	anger	blog
14038	must have been a dye job gone HELLA bad.	disgust	blog
14039	And I found out in the most annoying way.	disgust	blog
14040	I woke up on Wednesday morning, bright and early as I do to go into work/uni.	anticipation	blog
14041	I walked over to the heater as the first port of call and was very surprised when 'oh!' it wouldn't turn on.	surprise	blog
14042	Now I thought at first that maybe it had broken the night before, after I'd gone to bed or something.	noemotion	blog
14043	Trying to turn it back on only got me another automatic trip as lights flashed on for a brief moment, and then suddenly back off.	disgust	blog
14044	Grrrr - I then spent the next 10 minutes or so turning everything off in the house, switching the safety switch back on, and then sequentially turning everything back on until the safety was tripped.	anger	blog
14045	We thought for a while about what to do, not really being able to afford either a new fridge OR to fix this one.	sadness	blog
14046	At first one of my housemates thought about possibly buying a new fridge for themselves, but that idea was sadly left behind due to monetary issues.	sadness	blog
14047	In then end my other housemate's lovely girlfriend love you heaps babes.	joy	blog
14048	offered to give us her fridge woooo!.	joy	blog
14049	So, we've now gone over 48 hours without a fridge hate to think what half our food is like in there.	disgust	blog
14050	but will joyfully be picking the other one up today.	joy	blog
14051	In other news I have 6 days to go including today before I leave.	anticipation	blog
14052	As we wrote in a recent posting, even in a favorable political climate Democratic candidates face a significant challenge in turning out their base voters.	noemotion	blog
14053	Despite widespread dissatisfaction among Democrats with the Bush administration and overall Republican governance, we detect no real signs so far at least in Harris County of a groundswell to actually vote in November.	noemotion	blog
14054	An oft-repeated notion in recent weeks, however, has been that this year Republicans too will have a difficult time turning out their party faithful on November 7th.	noemotion	blog
14055	The argument goes that anger nationally over rising gas prices and health care costs, a protracted, expensive war with no conclusion in sight, and a perception among religious conservatives that George W. Bush has failed to deliver on the social issues that motivate them has taken a toll with GOP base voters.	noemotion	blog
14056	As noted in the latest issue of US News World Report, new polling has Republican insiders feeling pretty darn good about turning out their folks this fall, with confidence that they will vote to return their party's elected officials to power.	noemotion	blog
14057	The article cites a recent strategic memo to national GOP Party Chair Ken Mehlman from Market Strategies, which highlights polling granted, six-week old polling showing the base is in line and ready to hit the polls.	noemotion	blog
14058	Obviously no way to tell at this point, but any Democratic victory strategy that assumes weak Republican turnout as a key to winning is folly.	disgust	blog
14059	In other words, the mantra for Democratic candidates this political season: persuade everyone you can, turn out your base, and assume all the other guy's usual folks will vote.	trust	blog
14060	In other words Democrats, work like hell until November 7th.	noemotion	blog
14061	with a smile ofcourse.	joy	blog
14062	ive come to realise also how different i am with him.	surprise	blog

14074	stephen was a little abusive, mainly with words and feelings directed at me / to make me feel bad.	fear	blog
14075	chris had a problem with words too,and his anger.	anger	blog
14076	he could car eless about anything and everything as long as he got his way everything was alright.	disgust	blog
14077	other than that hed get offended or pissed off or ignorant about it.	anger	blog

14079	gudam, why did i waste so much time on his sorry ass.	disgust	blog
14080	oh yeh, i was sub-conciously restraining myself and waiting for Jamie >happy~.	joy	blog
14081	After church I went to one of my best friend's house for lunch.	joy	blog
14082	I saw the guy I went to a dance with once back at school there at her house.	noemotion	blog
14083	Haven't seen him in ages.	surprise	blog
14084	Hm, was a bit weird.	disgust	blog
14085	We had a good lunch with Gino Genelli ice-cream.	joy	blog
14086	However you spell the Genelli part Ah, we talked about Anri's ex and her mom mentioned how Anri was angry with her dad the one time the ex visited, cos her dad kept him busy most of the day.	noemotion	blog
14087	Anyhow her dad asked her then at the table but why would you be angry with your dad.	anger	blog
14088	Whahahaha I nearly cracked myself and don't think I didn't blush.	joy	blog
14089	Everyone at the table was giggeling.	joy	blog
14090	Then Anri wanted to go the beach, cos she just visited for the weekend and has to go back to where she studies in another suburb like hunderds of km's away from the ocean.	noemotion	blog
14091	We went in my car, cos apparently I have music.	noemotion	blog
14092	That be the only reason, cos everyone is scared of driving with me.  >.> Don't ask.	fear	blog
14093	We sat on the beach and mostly I felt like sleeping.	noemotion	blog
14094	I took photo's of this little girl swimming in the ocean.	noemotion	blog
14095	The water is freezing cold by the way and it is winter and we sat there dressed warmly.	noemotion	blog
14096	Somehow Anri got the idea in her head that I had to go test the water so that she can take photo's and like that was not enough I had to throw Baywatch moves.	noemotion	blog
14097	Funny photo's came out there.	joy	blog
14098	I wanted to take photo's of Kiteboarders, but there were none.	sadness	blog
14099	happy/ And some guy on a prepelled engine driven kite thing that was in the air.	joy	blog
14100	I would like to just walk around or sit somewhere where lotsa people are and take photo's of them, especially like action photo's.	other	blog
14101	cake ^.^ ICE-CREAM.	joy	blog
14102	Coffeee and dark chocolate.	noemotion	blog
14103	Lizelle wanted to go to the movies and I wanted to go to church and Anri I don't know what.	other	blog
14104	Really sad how we can actually sit and wonder in your one hand is God and the other hand is a movie.	sadness	blog
14105	Non-christians, don't worry about this part I am just expressing my thoughts, doesn't mean I don't accept you still as a person, just kinda thinking out loud to people that believe the same as me. Hmmm.	noemotion	blog
14106	so we went and it was nice to be there.	joy	blog
14107	Anri promised to come to my house after the movie to keep me awake while I work.	anticipation	blog
14108	Didn't think she would do it, but hey.	surprise	blog
14109	I sat there drawing and uhm the phone rang and it was the police.	surprise	blog
14110	I want to pose a serious question to anyone out there that chooses to read this.	noemotion	blog
14111	If you were given the choice between life and death, which one would you choose.	anticipation	blog
14112	No, I'm not a stupid chick for those of you that may be wondering.	anger	blog
14113	The choice does seem quite  obvious to me.  But what if you knew you were gonna die, like possibly sooner than later, for whatever reason.	fear	blog
14114	I have a friend that is gonna die, probably sooner than later, and I was  angry because some of the choices he has made in the last few years have cut his time down to virtually nothing.	anger	blog
14115	The whole world and it's endless possibilities are  stretched out before you.	anticipation	blog
14116	You have wonderful friends that love and cherish you.	joy	blog
14117	All you have to do is decide which opportunity you would like to take advantage of first.	anticipation	blog
14118	Then things start to take a turn in an unexpected direction.	surprise	blog
14119	Think constant arguing,  lies and deception, money mismanagement, and infidelity.	disgust	blog
14120	You figure, 'Hey, I might as well use this opportunity to see the world, make some money, and get an education and a marketable skill.'.	joy	blog
14121	So you make an appointment with a recruiter for an interview and physical.	noemotion	blog
14122	Everything goes well with the interview.	joy	blog
14123	The recruiter tells you that the technology field in which you are interested is growing rapidly and there are all types of jobs available that you can parlay into a lucrative career once you retire from the service.	anticipation	blog
14124	You leave there with a renewed sense of purpose and vow to take full advantage of this experience.	joy	blog
14125	You go home, wait two weeks, then return to the recruiter's office for the results of your background check and physical.	anticipation	blog
14126	The recruiter comes in the office with a look of sadness and disappointment.	sadness	blog
14127	You think to yourself that maybe you had too many traffic tickets, or maybe there was something small in your past that has presented you from being selected to join the military.	sadness	blog
14128	The look on the recruiter's face is unmistakable.	noemotion	blog
14129	You begin to prepare yourself to hear bad news and immediately go into self preservation mode to plan out your next move.	fear	blog
14130	He begins to speak while you're planning, I'm sorry to have to tell you thisok, I can move back home for a while and go back to school and work on my degree.	noemotion	blog
14131	, but we won't be able to welcome you into the Armed Forcesor I could do some traveling and explore the country.	noemotion	blog
14132	We have the results from your physicalI know, I'm gonna do some volunteer work with kids in the community.	noemotion	blog
14133	This is the story as it was given to me, and when I heard it I was pissed.	anger	blog
14134	But he assured me that he had used a condom and that I was the only one that he was having unprotected sex with.	disgust	blog
14135	So imagine my surprise  when I was about to engage in activities with him and saw an of color coming from you know where.	surprise	blog
14136	She then tells me that she's gonna test me for gonorrhea, but also that she's gonna have to test me for HIV.	fear	blog
14137	I'm like, For what.	noemotion	blog
14138	She tells me that if I was with a person that was infected with gonorrhea, what makes me think that person didn't have anything else.	disgust	blog
14139	Really, what did make me think that.	noemotion	blog
14140	I would have given this man, who obviously had little regard for me, my life in exchange for his bullshit and lies.	disgust	blog
14141	Fortunately, my test results came back negative for both gonorrhea and HIV.	joy	blog
14142	I was of course thankful, but I realized something very important during that time.	joy	blog
14143	I realized that my life belongs to me.  Fuck the bullshit.	anticipation	blog
14144	The second reason I was pissed was because not only was my friend is dying from this disease and has had it the entire time that we have been friends, but to my knowledge has not taken the appropriate care of himself that a person with HIV should be taking.	anger	blog
14145	He never went to see an infectious disease specialist.	noemotion	blog
14146	He never took any medications other than a multi-vitamin.	noemotion	blog
14147	He partied just as hard as I did, drank and smoked just as much weed as me.  So after I learned of his condition, I thought to myself, Is my friend trying to die.	sadness	blog
14148	When we first became friends he was an athelete, so he was pretty fit for the most part.	noemotion	blog
14149	I had never known to do much of anything unhealthy and  he was one of those health conscious, work out fanatics.	trust	blog
14150	Maybe he maintained that lifestyle in the beginning because he thought that  he could somehow combat his illness this way.	noemotion	blog
14151	I wonder what changed his mind about that.	noemotion	blog
14152	Could it be that he realized that no matter what he did, there was nothing that would get rid of his disease, so he lived and played hard and masked his pain with lots of partying, drugs, and lots of random, annonymous sex.	sadness	blog
14153	I've asked him about this, and he has never really given me an answer.	noemotion	blog
14154	But I think about it alot, and I wonder exactly when did he decide to die.	sadness	blog
14155	I wonder how many other people have made the same decision that he made.	anticipation	blog
14156	I wonder what choices I would have made differently had that nurse from the clinic given me different results.	noemotion	blog
14157	Would you choose to live, or would you choose to die.	other	blog
14158	The question itself is mostly rhetorical, presented to raise awareness and provoke thought moreso than response.	noemotion	blog
14159	However, if you are so compelled to do so, please leave your thoughts and comments.	noemotion	blog
14160	im going to be trashed.	anger	blog
14161	even tho i have work on monday which is my bday cause shop rite sucks my dick.	anger	blog
14162	im usually always so pumped for my bday.	anticipation	blog
14163	but right now its just reminding me that everyones leaving me.	sadness	blog
14164	i seriously dont know what i am going to do at all.	sadness	blog
14165	it just sucks when everything youve known for years just disappears.	sadness	blog
14166	i miss myrtle beach.	sadness	blog
14167	i cried on the way home from myrtle.	sadness	blog
14168	im hearbroken /3.	sadness	blog
14169	i just do not want to live at home anymore.	sadness	blog
14170	good b/c i def dont have the money to move out right now.	joy	blog
14171	bad b/c i want to move out mother eff.	anger	blog
14172	maybe things wont be so bad.	anticipation	blog
14173	then convince someone to move out with me.	anticipation	blog
14174	since everyone i wanted to get an apt with is now moving 29857938475 miles away all b/c of a freaking deadline.	disgust	blog
14175	Well, I'm surprised that I actually found it.	surprise	blog
14176	Jake's directions to the schools LJ account was wrong.	noemotion	blog
14177	so I searched for it and finally found it.	joy	blog
14178	You can't trust Jake's directions to his own bathroom in his own dorm room.	disgust	blog
14179	I so missed all the cool people I met at SHS.	sadness	blog
14180	I've been thinking a great deal about the importance of ritual.	noemotion	blog
14181	Not religious ritual like baptism or societal ritual like shaking hands, but personal ritual.	noemotion	blog
14182	I've been wondering which aspects of a behavior determine whether it's ritual or rut.	noemotion	blog
14183	And how I can possibly develop more rituals and fewer ruts in my life.	sadness	blog
14184	This has all come about because lately, I've been thinking about the Big Picture.	noemotion	blog
14185	The same thought keeps coming back to me: I lived my first 40 years largely as a leaf, blowing about in the wind.	sadness	blog
14186	Like that bag in American Beauty.	noemotion	blog
14187	I want the next 40 years to be lived on purpose.	anticipation	blog
14188	One of my most surprising observations about this whole ritual thing is how much easier it was to establish new rituals when I was on location, as opposed to being at home.	surprise	blog
14189	And, the corollary: how easy it is to slip into old habits, once back at home.	surprise	blog
14190	[It makes sense that there is concern for addicts or alcoholics who successfully gets straight or sober some place other than where they live.	noemotion	blog
14191	and then eventually have to return home to old triggers.	sadness	blog
14192	That, and they may not be exactly great for you.	disgust	blog
14193	I'm not advocating all-structure, all-the-time or anything.	noemotion	blog
14194	But I do know the perils of a life devoid of ritual.	noemotion	blog
14195	I'd like to say that my rituals are more active and crunchy.	noemotion	blog
14196	but alas, they aren't yet.	noemotion	blog
14197	Here are some rituals I HAVE managed to cultivate:.	noemotion	blog
14198	* Every day when I come home from work, the first thing I do is put on my pajamas.	noemotion	blog
14199	but when I started thinking about things I do regularly that I enjoy, that's definitely one of them.	joy	blog
14200	* A ritual I absolutely adore is going to the outdoor screenings at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery during the summer.	joy	blog
14201	There are all sorts of mini-rituals that go into this regular event, including the collection of picnic dinner items and the precision methodology by which one gets the perfect spot on the lawn.	noemotion	blog
14202	* When I'm NOT working, I have been known to take myself to brunch on the weekends: just me and whatever novel I'm currently enjoying.	joy	blog
14203	Maybe after this show ends, I'll be able to start a new garden.	anticipation	blog
14204	This is not good.	sadness	blog
14205	When I imagine the rituals of others, things like a daily, morning run something hard for me to fathom, I admit, meditation, feeding the ducks on Thursdays, after-dinner strolls with your family, poker night, date night.	noemotion	blog
14206	and the like are what come to mind.	noemotion	blog
14207	* I'm happy to taste any new flavor of ice cream I love to try new flavors!, but when it comes to ordering, it's always Mint Chip.	joy	blog
14208	* My fear of insomnia keeps me from going to bed when I'm really tired.	fear	blog
14209	Anyway, I don't want to sully this post with MY list of rituals and ruts.	noemotion	blog
14210	The image of cartoonist after cartoonist sitting at folding tables selling comic books is truly a pathetic one.	disgust	blog
14211	It can be ego-crushing when no one comes to buy anything.	sadness	blog
14212	- Bart Beaty, whom I had the pleasure of meeting at the show, from his Conversational Eurocomics column on what SPX could learn from some European conventions.	joy	blog
14213	I really enjoyed myself at SPX, that delightsome Bethesda megamall of rare and exclusive purchases and the men and women who brought the wares about.	joy	blog
14214	Don't sweat it, that's just my perception: I traveled the hour and a half trip down on Saturday with American Hero Chris Mautner he attained that storied status by agreeing to drive, arrived a half-hour after the doors opened, stayed until 5:30, then went right back home.	noemotion	blog
14215	That means I didn't see the Ignatz Awards, didn't partake of any post-show gatherings, and missed a big chunk of panels.	disgust	blog
14216	My SPX, in other words, was full of shopping and stalking the aisles.	noemotion	blog
14217	I met an awful lot of fine creators, but I hated taking up much of their table time; heaven knows by the afternoon there's a swarm of people waiting to trudge through the byways between tables, and one thousand distractions to attend to.	sadness	blog
14218	I'd never been to a comics show in my life, so I'd not known any SPX other than what was presented to me there: a pretty swank hotel, a table to pay at in the hall outside, and big ballroom with everyone selling everything inside, and a bunch of other rooms to have educational and informative events in, though all of those were down the hall, around the bend, and down an escalator.	disgust	blog
14219	Still, the separation-by-floor carried a certain symbolism for me when coupled with the atmosphere; upstairs was the carnival of monies and tables, downstairs were the talks and trophies.	joy	blog
14220	Upstairs there were masses of shoppers with bags and backpacks and totes, cookies and candies and muffins on certain tables to attract attention, and even a pair of folks operating hand puppets to entice a stray passerby.	joy	blog
14221	Downstairs there were hushed people crouched before open doors, the portals leading to capacity talks.	noemotion	blog
14222	All of it in a building off the highway, malls and fences and the whipping metal sea of vehicles all around it.	noemotion	blog
14223	To say there was no color at all would be misleading, since it was a nice day and there were a number of trees and things, but I did not detect any local pulse at all.	surprise	blog
14224	I went out for lunch with Chris and Gina Gagliano of First Second; food became curiously hard to find within hiking distance in the interests of full disclosure, my mastery of direction also had us walking the wrong way for a good while.	sadness	blog
14225	After we passed by a large parking lot promising a furniture blowout sale, as well as a haunted attraction and possibly ponies or something in the back, we decided to turn around and stop at a little diner we'd passed on the way.	joy	blog
14226	We hurried back from the gray highway to the center of comics and people, followed close behind by haunted ponies who'd just bought cheap Barcaloungers for their ghost stable and were now jonesing for independent comics.	noemotion	blog
14227	I love walking around for things to buy, and traveling less than two hours to arrive at the comics spread of my dreams won't raise too many personal hackles, let me tell you.	joy	blog
14228	I also made it a point to say hello to everyone there with whom I'd ever communicated on the internet, though I couldn't find anyone matching Johanna Draper Carlson's description and I totally missed Douglas Wolk.	noemotion	blog
14229	I'm also really glad I had Chris with me, since he knew a lot of faces that I didn't; he made a fine guide, though one of us would occasionally wander away from the other in the vein of the old NES version of Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, though I'm unsure as to which one of us was Bob Hoskins.	joy	blog
14230	Actually, I think maybe the best thing about SPX is how everyone is kind of pressed together, comics placed near one another seemingly without much concern for subject matter coherency I heard it was a bit different in prior years, with multiple selling rooms and all; if the creators in attendance and the books on display weren't a comprehensive picture of English-language non-superhero comics, there was at least enough diversity to manage the illusion of comprehensiveness.	joy	blog
14231	A diverse audience too, everything from young to old, from old-school nerds to stylish-looking folk, from aged hippies to teenage Goths.	joy	blog
14232	To look only at this crowd, you'd imagine that there was no question as to the diversity of the comics-reading audience.	noemotion	blog
14233	There was nowhere to sit in the former, since I got there late, so I sort of drifted in and out of hearing distance.	noemotion	blog
14234	At one point, McCloud began vigorously drawing a chart to illustrate different types of artists, all the while telling stories of the message board clashes between forces on places like the Comics Journal board.	joy	blog
14235	Someone behind me turned to someone else and whispered It's just like Civil War.	noemotion	blog
14236	Afterward a solid half-hour afterward, I believe, McCloud could be seen out in the hallway, taking questions from anyone who happened to want to talk to him away from the bustle of his table upstairs.	noemotion	blog
14237	The Chippendale talk was different, a highly entertaining, digression-prone ramble by the artist through his history and procedure, moderated by Dan Nadel and with extra bonus contributions from Brian Ralph, who was seated in the back of the room.	joy	blog
14238	Nobody was particularly brusque at SPX, at least from among the artists, but I found Chippendale to be consistently the most emphatic and friendly creator around.	joy	blog
14239	And I bought a good deal of stuff too.	noemotion	blog
14240	I tried to follow Tom's rule of not buying anything on my first trip around the room, but that didn't quite hold.	noemotion	blog
14241	I managed to get through the whole show without finding anything I really wanted sold out, however, and I only had to stand in the Line of Shame at the ATM once.	sadness	blog
14242	Abraxas and the Earthman by Rick Veitch debuted at the show, a collection of the Epic Illustrated serial; an additional collection of Veitch's short comics from the same venue is coming soon.	joy	blog
14243	Awakening Comics #1-2 by Steve Peters friends I reviewed his The Origin of Sparky a few weeks ago; having walked away from the table, and indeed the entire convention, I suddenly realized that I'd forgotten to actually tell Steve Peters who I was - another triumph of intellect.	joy	blog
14244	Cinema Sewer #19 edited by Robin Bougie new issue of the funny, comics-heavy pamphlet-format magazine devoted entirely to the finest in exploitation and pornographic film - a creator's personality-powered publication, and I assure you that Robin Bougie is in real life exactly the way he portrays himself in the mag.	noemotion	blog
14245	Cold Heat #1-2 of 12 by Ben Jones Frank Santoro #2 debuted at the show; the odd, semi-abstract fantasy/action book that Diamond initially disliked a while back, complaining of its format despite the fact that it's 100% a serialized pamphlet-format comic.	disgust	blog
14246	Comics Comics #1-2 edited by Timothy Hodler Dan Nadel I mentioned this yesterday, but didn't note that I also got a hard copy of issue #1.	noemotion	blog
14247	Ed the Happy Clown #2 of 9 by Chester Brown the one I was missing - who says you can't score back-issues at these things?.	noemotion	blog
14248	Fuzz Pluck in Splitsville #4 of 5 by Ted Stearn surely I can't be the only fan of the mighty Fuzz Pluck; still, I've never seen this in a store, though Fantagraphics had it at their table.	joy	blog
14249	2 #1: Heavy Metal by various from House of Twelve, a free giveaway show debut, parodying the original movie version of the magazine.	noemotion	blog
14250	New Tales of Old Palomar #1 of 3 by Gilbert Hernandez new miniseries of stand-alone tales, presented in the Ignatz format, debuting at a show featuring the Ignatz Awards; I remember when this was first released I heard it was going to be titled simply 'New Palomar' like it was New X-Men.	noemotion	blog
14251	Ninja by Brian Chippendale debuted at the show, probably the book of the show, and I've gushed enough already; when I went to Rick Veitch's table, he became momentarily transfixed with the transfixed and murmured I want to make a book like this.	joy	blog
14252	Paping #11 by various older issue of a deluxe anthology by some interesting-looking creators; the real showpiece was issue #14, with its solid wood covers and impressive prints 'n comics mishmash interior, the whole thing bound by red shoelaces; I just didn't have the roughly $30 needed to spend on it by that point in the show, though.	sadness	blog
14253	Project: Romantic by various debuted at the show, the newest in AdHouse's Project series of anthologies, this one strictly devoted to romance comics.	joy	blog
14254	Pulphope.A by Paul Pope a show exclusive, I think; not the full Pope art book coming soon from AdHouse, but a 200 copy ashcan with some exclusive stuff.	noemotion	blog
14255	Kelly's Trapped in the Closet Starring Batman Abridged by K. Thor Jensen a reenactment of the continuing American epic, with members of the Batman cast playing each role.	noemotion	blog
14256	So it was a nice trip.	joy	blog
14257	A lot of good things to have, and good hands to shake.	joy	blog
14258	I hope to do it again, and add on a few more convention experience points.	joy	blog
14259	No, it's alright, I've had a lot of time to come to terms with this.	noemotion	blog
14260	Some of my girlfriends have found it a little strange; I think it's one of the reasons they break up with me in the end, as if they need anymore reasons.	sadness	blog
14261	Because I can't just have a bedroom with bookshelves and dressers, or everyone would know something was wrong with me. And there is something wrong with me, but I just can't figure it out.	sadness	blog
14262	To try and remedy this, I spend my nights reading.	noemotion	blog
14263	I just finished a book about the importance of dreams.	noemotion	blog
14264	But it was a good read, and if I did have a dream where I had sex with my mother, well, now I'd know what it means.	joy	blog
14265	I guess it's hard to read about a condition when you don't know the name of it.	noemotion	blog
14266	I didn't always have this problem.	noemotion	blog
14267	Actually, I don't remember much about my childhood.	sadness	blog
14268	All this not sleeping has a terrible way of playing with your memory.	fear	blog
14269	I don't only feel like the days stretch on interminably.	noemotion	blog
14270	Just me in my room, reading my books and wondering what life would be like if I slept.	anticipation	blog
14271	Do I go to work again tomorrow morning.	noemotion	blog
14272	It's Sunday, but tomorrow might be a holiday.	noemotion	blog
14273	But I think I work on that holiday.	noemotion	blog
14274	It's not like a sleep in on the weekend.	noemotion	blog
14275	I'd tell my doctor, but I don't go to a doctor.	noemotion	blog
14276	I weigh about 180 lbs, I'm about 5', 10, I don't have anything that seems to be wrong with me. I have these weird scars on my neck.	noemotion	blog
14277	And there's the scar on my lip.	noemotion	blog
14278	I would say it was from some drunken night of excess, but I've never blacked out either.	noemotion	blog
14279	Oh, I get drunk, but nothing seems to happen to me where I forget.	noemotion	blog
14280	I remember every second, every horrific moment leaning over a toilet and puking.	disgust	blog
14281	It's unfair that I can remember things like that so well, yet I can't even tell you much about what happened in the rest of my life.	sadness	blog
14282	You'd think that'd be a problem at work, but it's menial stuff.	noemotion	blog
14283	I spend most of my time in my cube typing and filing, thinking about what I read the night before, trying to process it, trying to figure out what is/has been happening to me. Last night, I read As I Lay Dying by William Faulkner.	sadness	blog
14284	A shelf of clouds cover the sky, and Calhoun, choppy from the breeze, glitters only slightly.	noemotion	blog
14285	Soon the lake will be frozen, everyone walking on top of it.	anticipation	blog
14286	I guess it's getting colder, and it's getting to be time for dinner, or far enough after work, or whatever.	noemotion	blog
14287	I, on the other hand, have nothing to go home to.	sadness	blog
14288	I suppose the cold should annoy me. But it doesn't. I begin to take off my shoes.	noemotion	blog
14289	People stare as I dangle my feet into the lake in October.	noemotion	blog
14290	No one is in the lake, and I think everyone thinks something is wrong with me. Something is wrong me, but I still don't know what.	sadness	blog
14291	A person walks by me and says something, but I don't know what, and I'm singing something, but I can't place to tune.	noemotion	blog
14292	Something my mother sang to me to put me to sleep.	noemotion	blog
14293	I don't listen to music, but I know this song.	noemotion	blog
14294	My neck tingles as I hit the water and I sink, blowing bubbles.	surprise	blog
14295	They slowly stop coming out of my mouth, but my neck continues to tingle.	noemotion	blog
14296	For the first time in my life I feel completely normal.	joy	blog
14297	You're going to hear that a lot from me in the coming weeks, I think.	anticipation	blog
14298	What a suck-ass day this turned out to be.	disgust	blog
14299	Work was fucked up.	anger	blog
14300	Like Alice in Wonderland on a bad acid trip fucked up.	disgust	blog
14301	Mind you, I've been treated like the asshole of the house for the past couple of weeks, and I didn't even do anything at all to deserve it.	anger	blog
14302	But it's all good when folks need or want something, isn't it.	joy	blog
14303	And then one of them played a song that made me think of my mom, and suddenly, I'm so depressed that all I want to do is go curl up in a ball and die.	sadness	blog
14304	And now the MAIN instigator in the house has come home.	surprise	blog
14305	This last week at school was nuts- it was the first time that I can remember where I was putting in the hours in the lab, really busting my ass- classes are going well and I feel like it all ties in- which I really like.	joy	blog
14306	I'm sure by now most people heard about the really sad disappearance and murder of Michelle-Gardner Quinn, a UVM student.	sadness	blog
14307	It's pretty awful- there's not much else to say about it.	disgust	blog
14308	I found out about it on the way to Boston this weekend and I was just shocked.	surprise	blog
14309	I transferred from a school in an unsafe part of a city to UVM and found it to be much more laid back and free.	joy	blog
14310	Even just this last week there is a definite change in atmosphere around these parts that is pretty sad.	sadness	blog
14311	I really can't imagine what her family and friends are going through right now because it's a really unnecessary situation- she did not have to die and that's probably the saddest part.	sadness	blog
14312	It was so fun seeing everyone from way back- we ran into Eric and went out to see Michele so it was just so fun.	joy	blog
14313	Work and school are getting a little intense but I've found that I can do it- I just need to stay focused.	surprise	blog
14314	My brother turns 16 on Wednesday how.weird.	noemotion	blog
14315	and I am excited about the little booger haha.	anticipation	blog
14316	Last week was so busy that I just TRASHED it.	sadness	blog
14317	It needs a serious pick up and vacuum.	disgust	blog
14318	My mom would be so proud of me.	joy	blog
14319	no easy transition into this weather; it felt more like winter than fall up on the trail.	surprise	blog
14320	i didn't see her on Wednesday so i was surprised to find her at the shelter this morning.	surprise	blog
14321	once we got a the top of the trail and started to head down some spastic switch got turned on because she started acting a jumpy, darting all over the place, picking up stones, randomly chewing on tree roots, etc. she probably wanted to play but there's not much room for that on the trail especially on the way down a steep trail.	noemotion	blog
14322	i was surprised to see her sitting so still; spastic switch must have been turned off.	surprise	blog
14323	T started off with Smiley; a 2-3 year-old shepard-pitbull mix.	noemotion	blog
14324	he was a stray, found wandering Discovery Park.	noemotion	blog
14325	he has a bad left eye which i don't think he has any vision.	noemotion	blog
14326	during the run we were calling him Lance since he was nameless because when he was laying on his back in the grass he would kick his legs like he was riding a bike; i wrote this stuff down on his sheet but i guess the officer's didn't like the name.	noemotion	blog
14327	It was fun-filled.	joy	blog
14328	I didn't even think about what I was wearing or anything and just left.	noemotion	blog
14329	His dad didn't mind us taking pictures but I think this boy did.	noemotion	blog
14330	super hilarious! Oh well~ He was one coolio child.	joy	blog
14331	It was like 8 in the morning and so.	noemotion	blog
14332	SO, this is where we begin our journey.	anticipation	blog
14333	Thousands and thousands of people attended.	noemotion	blog
14334	Along the way, Christina, Kevan, Eff, and I played the alphabet game like in a gazillion different versions.	noemotion	blog
14335	Two hours with Kevan, I should get credit for surviving that long with that nerd.	disgust	blog
14336	Eff questions how the belt keeps up his pants.	noemotion	blog
14337	Mr. Fortune Cookie, you are the bomb-diggity.	joy	blog
14338	Daos, you guys complete me. super hilarious.	joy	blog
14339	super hilarious! Yes people, he was baring a child, and then someone popped it.	joy	blog
14340	Interact ended up being a whole ton better than I had expected.	joy	blog
14341	That's all for now, I have homework.	noemotion	blog
14342	watching Mother Nature's lightshow, I see.	noemotion	blog
14343	enormous mounds of gray cotton batting clouds, only momentarily visible as they are back-lit by silent, random flashbulbs.	noemotion	blog
14344	The sand wrapping my feet is now warmer than the air.	noemotion	blog
14345	I stretch my arms out as far as they will reach just as the first drum rolls of thunder pound my ears.	noemotion	blog
14346	Slightly swaying with the breeze, I can feel the deep vibration moving through me.  around me.  and away.	joy	blog
14347	Being the tallest object on the beach in a thunderstorm and living to write about it.	surprise	blog
14348	Although my brother likes to point out the fact that every day for me is a weekend.	noemotion	blog
14349	Regardless of my temporal status as far as my brother is concerned, time still moves ahead at a frighteningly rapid pace.	fear	blog
14350	Speaking of time, this morning amazon dot com and myself transacted some by business.	noemotion	blog
14351	I ordered the first season of Doctor Who on DVD.	anticipation	blog
14352	No, not the new first season, the William Hartnell black and white forty years ago suck it I'm the first Doctor first season.	noemotion	blog
14353	Once I have them all then I think I'll start on Blackadder.	noemotion	blog
14354	I'm sorry but British television rules.	joy	blog
14355	I spent the majority of the day up in Madison hi Robby, I would have waved but I'm not sure where your house is.	noemotion	blog
14356	Their historical society was having a century home tour as a fund raiser and my mother wanted to go.	noemotion	blog
14357	I assumed that with my niece in New York and my sister working a weekend job to keep her there that it would just be my mother and I; little did I know that she invited my sister-in-law to accompany us.	surprise	blog
14358	Spending quality time with my sister-in-law is. different.	noemotion	blog
14359	This coming week I intend to get serious about my real estate venture by establishing a revolving line of credit at the bank.	anticipation	blog
14360	I am actively seeking foreclosures and other deals, however, if I find one I want to get the financing out of the way to allow me to move quickly.	noemotion	blog
14361	It's not so much a matter of the early bird getting the worm as it is the procrastinating bird getting splattered by the semi out on I-90.	disgust	blog
14362	Well, we're half-way through our trip.	noemotion	blog
14363	I can't believe it.	surprise	blog
14364	We're planning on staying two nights in Venice.	anticipation	blog
14365	There is a church or ruins everywhere you look.	noemotion	blog
14366	To enter the Museums it was about a two hour wait.	noemotion	blog
14367	The lines around the wall was insanely long.	disgust	blog
14368	In October the Museums close quite early 1:20pm, so by the time we got in we didn't have a whole lot of time to see things.	sadness	blog
14369	I would have loved to see the Library, but we didn't get to it.	sadness	blog
14370	After eating a quick meal we walked around the outside of the wall trying to find St. Peter's Basilica.	anticipation	blog
14371	We walked around pretty much the entire city until we found it.	anticipation	blog
14372	Again, we stood in line to enter the church.	anticipation	blog
14373	Didn't have to wait too long, though.	noemotion	blog
14374	I can't believe they do that.	surprise	blog
14375	So anyway, Rome in general was loud, dirty and absolutely chock-full of people and cars and bikes.	disgust	blog
14376	The city really is like a human being, especially in the morning as you watch and hear it begin to awaken.	noemotion	blog
14377	I've been trying not to think about my life back home, but sometimes it sneaks in, uninvited.	sadness	blog
14378	Should I take the job Jamie offered me? Should I stay in Salem.	noemotion	blog
14379	what really happened was that an earthquake started and instead of waking up first i incorporated it into a dream where i was watching a documentary about earthquakes and they were recounting some classic earthquake showing how it would pulse stronger and stronger.	noemotion	blog
14380	i was very attentive, and it didn't seem like she was gonna break, so i just stayed there and eventually it stopped and i passed out again.	sadness	blog
14381	then he calls again and, knowing that's the international sign for pick up the frickin' phone, i picked it up thinkin' there was something wrong with him.	anger	blog
14382	his gf 's mom had called him.	noemotion	blog
14383	eitherw ay, finally got up for a while after talkin to him and my sis and mom, listened to the radio for a little while on my MP3 player cause the power was knocked out and it was all fine.	noemotion	blog
14384	so i went back to sleep till noon, took beau for a walk, surfed for four hours, cooked in the dark, read by candlelight for a little while, adn then the power came back on so i could watch tv.	noemotion	blog
14385	all my plans were shot to shit cause the cell waves were all packed and i couldn't get in touch with my friends very well.	anger	blog
14386	and there was a storm at the same time so that didn't help.	fear	blog
14387	useless day.	disgust	blog
14388	then i needed a drink and naturally don't have beer, and i expected all the beer at the supermarket to be warm.	anticipation	blog
14389	oh, earthquake was rated highest at a 6.6.	fear	blog
14390	definitely in the audible range and very regular.	noemotion	blog
14391	an avalanche movie sounds or rock slide.	noemotion	blog
14392	or how they make them sound in movies.	noemotion	blog
14393	the amount of energy required to move that much mass SUSTAINED at such a high frequency is ridiculous.	surprise	blog
14394	Earlier this week, Karina had invited me over to her townhouse.	anticipation	blog
14395	She said that Kubik would be hanging out, and I could come if I wanted.	noemotion	blog
14396	I got there a little after 7, Project Runway reruns playing on Bravo, and I asked, Where's Kubik? because she's usually very punctual.	surprise	blog
14397	I take a seat in the armchair across from Karina, and while she's talking, a face appears in the window behind her, grinning and waving enthusiastically.	surprise	blog
14398	Kubik gets a plate for her Chipotle burrito, and I ask for tea to dilute the effects of the two cups of coffee I had earlier.	noemotion	blog
14399	Karina prepared a plate of 3 cheeses, red peppers, crackers, and we settle in front of the TV for some Project Runway.	noemotion	blog
14400	Original plan was to watch Brokeback Mountain, but I saw that 1962 version of The Manchurian Candidate is on, and ask if we can watch that.	anticipation	blog
14401	The two of them watch it, I half watch the movie while reading the newspaper, sometimes out loud, but Kubik complains, SOMEONE IS TALKING while I'm trying to watch a movie! but Karina defends me, You're one to talk.	anger	blog
14402	This is too intense, with Karina asking if she needs to step outside.	surprise	blog
14403	We watch Project Runway, but the repetition of the same 5 commercials becomes old fast.	disgust	blog
14404	Around 1 pm, Karina tells us that we need to leave because it's late.	noemotion	blog
14405	As I'm walking to the metro station, a teenage boy in his mixed group of 4 or 5 friends hanging outside yells, I like your haircut! and I answer, Thanks, while I keep walking having seen Erica and Diana enter a little bit earlier.	noemotion	blog
14406	A compliment from a trendy teenager can brighten up anyone's day.	joy	blog
14407	The three of us find our way to the Spy Museum and I'm surprised by the number of young couples who are there, in addition to the usual elderly tourists and young families.	surprise	blog
14408	I'm the slowest to go through the exhibits, and I soon lose Erica and Diana, occasionally catching up with them when they slow down.	noemotion	blog
14409	The fake vent opens to another part of the exhibit, and I get out.	noemotion	blog
14410	While I'm looking at an exhibit on bugging devices, this kid comes up behind me and hands me the pamphlet, You dropped this.	noemotion	blog
14411	Later, there's a phone booth that rings for visitors to pick up, but our timing is never quite right.	surprise	blog
14412	We stop in the gift shop before heading home.	noemotion	blog
14413	The wind blows strongly outside, and Diana has a hard time pushing open the door, but a 7 or 8 year old boy who's already exited with his family helps her out by pulling while she pushes.	noemotion	blog
14414	I woke up early and checked on my little Chirp.	noemotion	blog
14415	It was cute.	joy	blog
14416	I dipped my finger into the water and she drank the water that collected on it when I put it close to her.	noemotion	blog
14417	She is looking better than she did, but hasn't eaten anything, so I hope she continues to heal.	anticipation	blog
14418	I had to fly out the door this morning and ended up being 10 minutes late for class, but we were doing a group project, so I dived in and did my part.	noemotion	blog
14419	Josh a.k.a the creep, who I'm in the group with, has been tolerable.	noemotion	blog
14420	I think he knows not to cross the line he crossed once before.	noemotion	blog
14421	There wasn't really nothing on campus I could do that I felt like doing.	other	blog
14422	I did spend some time on the Live Journal looking for pictures/ userpics.	noemotion	blog
14423	I love her outfit as well, except I think the laughing after she wins a fight in street fighter is kind of silly, but that's just me. Kikyo, from the Inuyasha series, has been another favorite of mine.	joy	blog
14424	I find myself relating to her alot.	trust	blog
14425	The remake and the character Deunan Knute just engaged me big time, so I had to include some pictures.	joy	blog
14426	Wish I could get that ES.W.A.T uniform she wears.	anticipation	blog
14427	Matt I actually think you may like this one.	joy	blog
14428	So, that's what I did for like a half an hour.	noemotion	blog
14429	Went home and finished the luncheon posters than I had to leave early for my eye appointment.	noemotion	blog
14430	I still have a few other appointments.	noemotion	blog
14431	medical and dental, but I definetly need my loan to secure all my funds.	noemotion	blog
14432	I than went to Office Max and got two jump drives.	noemotion	blog
14433	I think the cashier made a mistake, but I didn't say anything.	surprise	blog
14434	I believe she entered in $17.88, instead of $18.88, so I got an unexpected discount.	surprise	blog
14435	It's a SanDisk Micro 1.0 GB jump drive, so not a bad deal.	joy	blog
14436	Worked out at the YMCA and took a long relaxing shower after a stay in the sauna.	joy	blog
14437	my guy hasn't seen me for about 4 months, so I wanted to look nice.	anticipation	blog
14438	I've not been acting like myself and I know it.	fear	blog
14439	You are the antidote that gets me by.	joy	blog
14440	You were the antidote that got me by.	trust	blog
14441	Mrangelmeg and I took his cousin Lilli to St Meinrad with us on Friday evening for a couple of functions that happened to be going on that evening in conjunction with this semester's lay student class weekend.	noemotion	blog
14442	As I have said before I am happily not taking a class this semester, but these two particular functions were ones that were not to be missed.	joy	blog
14443	The first was the dedication of a painting that was donated to the school by the students of Fr Damien Dietlein OSB, the Old Testament Professor there.	noemotion	blog
14444	The picture is called Exodus and is of Moses and the Israelites crossing the Red Sea, painted by an Ethiopian artist who currently lives in South Dakota.	noemotion	blog
14445	The entire enterprise was done as a surprise to Damo our name for Father and he was genuinely touched and surprised by the affair.	surprise	blog
14446	The other activity was the inaugural session of Theology in the Round, a session intended to bring Seminarians, Lay Students and Alumni together for an evening of discussion surrounding a topic chosen by a guest speaker.	noemotion	blog
14447	The evening's speaker happened to be another of my professors: Fr.	noemotion	blog
14448	Denis Robinson OSB whom I had for Early Church History and had been telling mrangelmeg about for months.	noemotion	blog
14449	His topic was John Henry Newman and Catholic Education.	noemotion	blog
14450	I really wanted mrangelmeg to have a chance to experience Fr.	anticipation	blog
14451	Denis because he is a force with which to be reckoned.	noemotion	blog
14452	After that discussion we spent some time in the little bar on campus which is called the Unstable  Benedictines take a vow of stability, so they call the bar, the Unstable, get it.	joy	blog
14453	visiting with all my friends who are there for class this weekend while I am not.	noemotion	blog
14454	And we got to see the Extreme Makeover Home Edition house in St. Meinrad the town as we drove to the Monastery.	joy	blog
14455	I have to admit, knowing that those of my friends who were there for Fr.	trust	blog
14456	Denis' class on Creed were having a quiz on Heresies in the early church on Saturday morning I was more than happy to be returning home Friday night.	joy	blog
14457	And forget the Internet, where as much as 75% of all information is general nonsense.	disgust	blog
14458	Enter stage left: Daniel's Five Minute Guides.	noemotion	blog
14459	something the Internet has been missing since it was born.	joy	blog
14460	Try out this first primer, a quick five minute guide to learning and loving classical music.	joy	blog
14461	Five minutes is all you need, so grab a glass of your favorite wine, and enjoy your newfound knowledge.	joy	blog
14462	If these prissy little installments are truly helpful, I may just have to take more requests.	surprise	blog
14463	Welcome to the world of classical music.	noemotion	blog
14464	It's my world, a place where music in endless forms and varieties give me an entire lifetime of listening pleasure.	joy	blog
14465	It's the oldest recognized type of music in Western civilization, and it dates back well into the Middle Ages.	joy	blog
14466	Since classical music is the oldest and largest genre of music in existence, let's study this music from one era to the next.	noemotion	blog
14467	Most music historians identify anywhere from four to seven distinct eras in classical music, and since I recognize all seven, let's learn about each one:.	noemotion	blog
14468	Middle Ages 450 A.D. to 1450 A.D: Shortly after the fall of the Roman Empire, the first era of classical music was born.	noemotion	blog
14469	Our first composers were mostly supported by the church surprise!, and religion influenced early classical music more than any other source.	joy	blog
14470	There was no formal system of notation, making composing very difficult and time-consuming.	noemotion	blog
14471	Gregorian chants were written during these ancient times.	noemotion	blog
14472	Renaissance 1450 - 1600: Humans discovered that Earth is not the center of the universe, so classical music changed along with the rest of the arts.	noemotion	blog
14473	Music became more of an expressive art than a science, and music was now being printed, allowing sacred, secular, and instrumental music to spread everywhere.	joy	blog
14474	Governments now influenced the spread of the era's music more than the church.	noemotion	blog
14475	Baroque 1600-1750: The era of Bach, Handel, and Vivaldi saw the development of almost every modern instrument in use today, particularly the violin, clarinet, and piano.	noemotion	blog
14476	Composers developed the idea of the sonata, the concerto, and the symphony, where great performers called virtuosos found enormous success.	joy	blog
14477	Composers used counterpoint, dance rhythms and repetition in their music.	noemotion	blog
14478	Think of this brief period as a launch platform of all the modern music to follow.	anticipation	blog
14479	Anyway, classical music wasn't even called classical music back in this time.	noemotion	blog
14480	You can find nearly all of the most popular composers in this era, namely Mozart and Beethoven both of whom didn't know they were writing classical.	noemotion	blog
14481	They used simple ideas, simple textures, and simple forms, all of which make for great listening material.	joy	blog
14482	Romantic 1825-1900: Lush and beautiful music was the prevailing theme during most of the 1800s, and music was written to tell stories, to depict the mysteries of nature, or to express the upper reaches of human emotions.	joy	blog
14483	Composers of this era such as Tchaikovsky, Brahms, and Chopin wrote music with a wider dynamic range, using a larger variety of instruments.	noemotion	blog
14484	Female composers gained more visibility during this period, such as Clara Schumann.	noemotion	blog
14485	20th Century: 1900-1999: Classical music exploded, evolved and splintered faster than it ever had before.	noemotion	blog
14486	New subcategories of classical music were born every year, and more composers were writing music than all previous eras combined.	noemotion	blog
14487	Music of this era was influenced by anything and everything, including world wars, politics, SEX, and cross-pollination by other types of music such as jazz.	noemotion	blog
14488	And anything and everything was possible, from atonal to experimental to electronic.	noemotion	blog
14489	Finally, music could be recorded and distributed widely, creating a burgeoning market for all types of new music.	joy	blog
14490	Over one hundred thousand composers fall into this period, including Copland, Stravinsky, and Ravel.	noemotion	blog
14491	Needless to say, neither the church nor the government contributed much to classical music in this century.	disgust	blog
14492	Contemporary Classical: 1970 - 2050 projected: If the 20th Century period ends in 1999, then what do we call all classical music written thereafter.	noemotion	blog
14493	Welcome to the contemporary classical period, where we see even more subcategories such as the minimalism of Philip Glass, the electric opera by John Corigliano, and the twelve-tone works of John Bilotta, a Bay Area composer.	noemotion	blog
14494	The few creative barriers that may have been left after the 20th century have been crushed by a whopping 300,000 living composers, and this contemporary period gives new meaning to the phrase Anything Goes.	anticipation	blog
14495	There is so much more to learn, but this is your first step into removing the mystery from these vast eras.	noemotion	blog
14496	Your next few leaps into classical music should now be a little easier.	noemotion	blog
14497	The autoplay in each entry will be set to off, but please don't be shy, click play.	noemotion	blog

14499	Measure 40 amends the state constitution to require supreme court and appeals judges to be elected by district instead of the statewide vote that currently happens.	noemotion	blog
14500	8 of the pro arguments consist of someone listing what I take to be every single county in Oregon from which there are no appellate judges.	noemotion	blog
14501	Both sides have a mixture of more polemic arguments and more reasonable arguments.	noemotion	blog
14502	There's all kinds of thought about how the measure will make judicial positions more or less political, whether those positions already are political, whether it matters that the Oregon constitution originally had district elections and switched to statewide some time ago, whether elections by district mean that some of the judges will be less qualified than others could have been or whether it means that currently underrepresented areas think every rural area will have a better chance to have someone who understands them in the appellate courts, etc.	noemotion	blog
14503	All in all, most of the arguments are not very convincing one way or the other.	disgust	blog
14504	One of the few that seemed to me to say something worth saying was an argument in favor that was written by Ron Saxton.	joy	blog
14505	This surprised me, because I know from TV ads that Ron Saxton is running for something or other.	surprise	blog
14506	As such I consider him to be primarily a politician, and it is rare that I find what I might consider words of wisdom from a politician, even when I agree with them.	surprise	blog
14507	The one other somewhat-convincing argument was immediately after that one, also in favor, by an organization of Oregon farmers.	noemotion	blog
14508	They talked about how it would be nice if some of the appellate judges understood how farms operate when lawsuits against farmers come up.	anger	blog
14509	There seemed to be at least a smidgen of personal experience reflected in that argument, something not really present anywhere else.	noemotion	blog
14510	So I'm leaning slightly in favor, although I mostly don't see how it will make that big of a difference.	noemotion	blog

14538	Seeing a scarred, bearded man in a rippling black overcoat warmed my heart, because his fingers were painting a trembling solo on his acoustic guitar.	joy	blog
14539	I sat down beside him and ran lines in my head for a while, while a few feet away the song poured from his strings.	joy	blog
14540	Eventually, the music faded away, and the guitar slipped back into its bag.	noemotion	blog
14541	I looked up from my script and thanked him for playing.	joy	blog

14554	Many times, I'll hear commentators, and sometimes I'll even agree with them.	noemotion	blog
14555	Assumption: That's because Markets[sic] are much better at collecting and evaluating information than anything else on the planet.	noemotion	blog
14556	Markets do not measure everything accurately, and I find this assumption to be disgusting.	disgust	blog
14557	Biodiversity isn't measured because it is more complex than one transaction.	noemotion	blog
14558	And the Walmartisation of the world changes markets for the worse for labour, making people a mere slot in a computerised schedule, with no regard for their free time.	disgust	blog
14559	Forcing the world into markets is exactly what creates so many problems in the world *ahem* people are at war with us over it, you know.	disgust	blog
14560	It is like throwing everything you eat into a meat grinder.	disgust	blog
14561	It makes everything homogeneous in texture, sure, but you never are able to enjoy it in its own context.	joy	blog
14562	Let's not promote gambling the security and livelihoods of people just because they're a few thousand miles away or brown.	disgust	blog
14563	And who would be the bastard who profits off of the destruction of my workplace and life.	anger	blog
14564	Yes, Ms Lee mentions insurance.	noemotion	blog
14565	Comment: Traders, those who buy and sell the contracts, bring all their disparate information on the political situation in Saudi Arabia into this central marketplace.	noemotion	blog
14566	Their bets on the probability of this one terrorist action would be reflected in the price of the contract.	noemotion	blog
14567	Would Ms Lee be throwing out these ideas for the US elections.	noemotion	blog
14568	Plus, in such a secretive government, wouldn't this promote corruption.	noemotion	blog
14569	The selling of top secret documents to profit off of the killing of 150 people in a mosque.	disgust	blog
14570	And there's really no reason to encourage those who can afford to gamble on this sort of thing to do something so dispicable and amoral.	disgust	blog
14571	It is sickening.	disgust	blog
14572	There is so much room for the worst of humanity in doing things like this, let's not encourage it, please.	disgust	blog
14573	In the last three years, terrorism has flourished.	noemotion	blog
14574	Here's another great case of Redcoat Logic.	disgust	blog
14575	Joementum manages to dive on the recent threat-ish that emerged from Britain and turn it all around to make a comment on Ned and the democrats.	joy	blog
14576	Apparently the extremist terrorists in Britain are connected to the insurgents in Iraq despite the fact that the former were pure terrorists and the latter are involved in a civil war, and that a slow exit from Iraq was their goal.	noemotion	blog
14577	That's why they went for the British airports.	noemotion	blog
14578	Does no one see the problem with that logic.	disgust	blog
14579	The war in Iraq is fighting terrorists.	noemotion	blog
14580	Terrorists are all one giant unit.	noemotion	blog
14581	The terrorists want us out of Iraq.	noemotion	blog
14582	As long as terrorists exist, we can't get out of Iraq.	noemotion	blog
14583	As long as there are any terrorists anywhere doing anything, we can't pull out.	disgust	blog
14584	The state of Iraq, what the Iraqi people want, all of that jazz, it's never spoken of at times like these.	sadness	blog
14585	All that matters is that terrorists want us out of Iraq, so that means we have to stay.	sadness	blog
14586	I'd also like to point out that the liberal complaint is not that we're fighting terrorists, it's that we're NOT fighting terrorists.	noemotion	blog
14587	The complaint is that we abandoned the search for bin Laden in Afghanistan and went into Iraq under incredibly false premises.	anger	blog
14588	I'm worried that too many people, both in politics and out, don't appreciate the seriousness of the threat to American security and the evil of the enemy that faces us, Mr. Lieberman said at the Waterbury event.	fear	blog
14589	He called that threat more evil, or as evil, as Nazism and probably more dangerous than the Soviet Communists we fought during the long cold war.	fear	blog
14590	To suggest that a couple of disorganized idiots trying to replicate Yousef's 1995 plot is more evil and more dangerous than what they did is beyond off-base, beyond stupid.	anger	blog
14591	Another apocalyptic vision last night: wandering through large rooms that are stuffy and crowded with people lying on the floor covered with sheets, most of them separate from each other.	fear	blog
14592	Some aggressive people with mean faces and nasty attitudes staking out their turf, telling us to move along.	disgust	blog
14593	We try to find comfortable space and head down a winding staircase that seems to get smaller as it gets to the bottom.	fear	blog
14594	Then I am outside and they are calling the name D'Angelo for people to board rescue vehicles.	noemotion	blog
14595	The bees and the body somehow melt away as the rescue vehicles begin to depart - leaving me behind.	disgust	blog
14596	I am, by no means, an art critic.	noemotion	blog
14597	I know very little about art, save the few well-known artists that everyone knows.	noemotion	blog
14598	For my birthday, Jon took me to the Getty Center in Los Angeles.	joy	blog
14599	The Getty Museum in LA stems from his collection.	noemotion	blog
14600	Now, understand, when it comes right down to it, I am a hick from the sticks.	noemotion	blog
14601	The only art I have ever been exposed to is the stuff that pretentious college drop-outs create and try to sell by hanging it on the walls for coffee shops.	disgust	blog
14602	I had never before seen a work by any of the Masters - the closest I have ever gotten to a Michelangelo is watching Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.	noemotion	blog
14603	It's easy to Google Image search Monet and look at the results, but pictures and posters hold no candle to the real deal.	noemotion	blog
14604	Oh, and I think I made the security guards really nervous - like I was going to blow my runny nose on the Renoir and forever ruin it with my bodily fluids.	disgust	blog
14605	Pretty, no? You should see it in person.	disgust	blog
14606	Like I said, I'm no judge of art.	noemotion	blog
14607	The purpose - to catch Body Worlds 2 while we could the exhibit had already come and gone to LA, so this was the only chance we would get.	noemotion	blog
14608	I was excited to see it as I have a fondness of cadavers blame Gross Anatomy and really wanted to get another shot at some up close anatomy viewing.	anticipation	blog
14609	A glenoid-humoral joint. Some of the exhibits were very interesting, such as  the soccer player and the skateboarder.	joy	blog
14610	In Gross Anatomy, our cadavers were solemn - laying on the tables as if in a deep slumber.	noemotion	blog
14611	The odd thing about Body Worlds is that it goes from being an anatomy exhibit to being a sort of Cadaver Carnival of Bizarre Art.	surprise	blog
14612	I can't find any good images of the weird displays, so to view some you have to look here at the International Body Worlds Online Store.	noemotion	blog
14613	Again, I am no judge of art, and the fact that this exhibit has drawn record numbers of people hint at the possibility that I am off-base.	noemotion	blog
14614	Body Worlds is great in that it gives everyday people the chance to look at the machinery that is the body.	joy	blog
14615	Now, people can see that organs are not the cartoonish objects that one sees in a book.	noemotion	blog
14616	The general public also has a chance to look at diseased organs something usually reserved for pathologists, who, I've noticed, seem to get *very* excited over things like polyps and necrosis.	joy	blog
14617	They have the blood vessels of various limbs that have been injected with polymers so that you can witness the intricacies of the blood supply.	noemotion	blog
14618	The basic anatomy and bodies in motion portions are a must see.	joy	blog
14619	However, for me, the more artistic exhibits were more of a turn off - I willingly admit that I was very attached to my cadaver in Gross, and the thought of him being displayed like that makes me a bit sick.	disgust	blog
14620	Then again, I'm not a good judge of art.	noemotion	blog
14621	As an aside, there have been some interesting articles regarding the aquisition of cadavers for exhibits such as Body Worlds I guess the entire affair has sparked various knock-off exhibits.	noemotion	blog
14622	While this country has access to huge numbers of scientists and medical students someone has to do the dirty work there have been some controversies, and questions as to where the cadavers come from.	disgust	blog
14623	The creator of Body Worlds has denied that his specimines have been acquired in any dubious manner, and has documentation to that effect.	noemotion	blog
14624	However, some of the knock-offs might not be as professional personally, I'd avoid them if I were you.	disgust	blog
14625	I won't make any more comments about it, and leave it in your hands.	noemotion	blog
14626	I'm also constantly congested, and I've been having drainage in my throat.	sadness	blog
14627	My energy level is starting to increase more and more.	noemotion	blog
14628	I was able to tell all of the teachers at school that I am pregnant, so it's been fun to hear all of their pregnancy stories.	joy	blog
14629	Since school is just starting, we've been eating a lot, and it's funny because they are letting me get away with going first saying I am eating for two.	joy	blog
14630	Everyone keeps asking if we're going to find out if we're having a boy or girl.	noemotion	blog
14631	Jessica and Scott are outside on the porch playing a card game together.	noemotion	blog
14632	This afternoon, I went shopping for school supplies.	noemotion	blog
14633	Summer has gotten to me, and now it needs to leave.	sadness	blog
14634	The most exciting time of my whole summer was going to Virginia with the Patricks, Pearsons and Roths, and that lasted less than a week.	joy	blog
14635	Tomorrow, I hope either my mother or father takes me to go buy school clothes.	anticipation	blog
14636	I don't except them to, because my Dad is taking my brother golfing as previously stated, and my mother hates the mall more than she hates anything else.	disgust	blog
14637	Scott is losing the card game, from what I can hear.	noemotion	blog
14638	My mother just asked Chris, How would you prefer your crab.	noemotion	blog
14639	I tried making a collage of magazine cutouts or in my case, rip outs.	noemotion	blog
14640	It looks like somebody puked up several golds and pinks, and then pasted it on a canvas.	disgust	blog
14641	She was just eating cat food a few feet away from me. She saw my brother look at her, and ran away.	sadness	blog
14642	As she was running, a kernel of catfood fell from her mouth, and now it's all soggy on the floor.	noemotion	blog
14643	i freakin hate when you get in a bad mood and its not just one thing.	anger	blog
14644	its just kinda just a bunch of little things and then you get sad and you just want to go cry and just be away from reality.	sadness	blog
14645	i mean i know but i cant put it into words and i just dont want to say it i guess.	noemotion	blog
14646	and im not trying to be mean but if i say i dislike someone and you are like why why why and i try to explain but you're just like thats stupid you shouldnt dislike her it pisses me off if i have to defend myself for disliking someone.	anger	blog
14647	i mean i have my reason to dislike someone and you shouldnt question them cuz you arent me and you dont know and just stop.	anger	blog
14648	i consider myself a nice person and i should have the right to dislike some people.	noemotion	blog
14649	i give everyone a fair chance i think.	noemotion	blog
14650	It wasn't because I was sad though.	noemotion	blog
14651	I looked over at Jon and I said Hey, I feel like I'm going to pass out.	anticipation	blog
14652	Then I guess my head slammed into the window behind me and I fell on the floor.	sadness	blog
14653	I woke up to Jon picking up my head and saying my name, but I couldn't hear him.	noemotion	blog
14654	It's because of thing called vasovagal syncope and was triggered because I have a kidney infection that was making me dehydrated and nauseous.	noemotion	blog
14655	I hope I can at least pass out sometime when it's sweet, like when I'm driving or operating heavy machinery.	sadness	blog
14656	I know I have not been writing 4 a long time.	trust	blog
14657	I will never try one again and i suggest you do the same.	disgust	blog
14658	It started raining jus B4 it started.	noemotion	blog
14659	I did not climb very high up but was not bad either.	noemotion	blog
14660	I spent my national day like I always do at home to watch the national parade.	noemotion	blog
14661	My school choir was taking part and i saw them too.	noemotion	blog
14662	I guess it's a lot more involved than I had thought.	surprise	blog
14663	Anyway, as the day proceeded it seemed to be getting easier, and I was so sure I had the basics down pat.	joy	blog
14664	I felt this way up until it was time to count my drawer.	noemotion	blog
14665	After that I had pretty much decided that it was giving up time.	disgust	blog
14666	I guess that made me feel a little bit more at ease.	joy	blog
14667	OF course I was stressing it too much because as the day proceeded, I began to feel myself becoming more and more comfortable with everything.	surprise	blog
14668	The end of the day came and it was than time to count out my drawer.	noemotion	blog
14669	My change was exact down to the last penny, what a relief that was for me laughing out loud.	joy	blog
14670	Today day three went relatively smoothe.	joy	blog
14671	But it was wasn't so bad since I got to hang out with Lauren the night before :]To make this somewhat shorter.	joy	blog
14672	My charges were.50 short, but apparently that's not a horrible thing.	fear	blog
14673	Tomorrow I have to go in at 8 and stay till 5pm.	noemotion	blog
14674	Urrr two more hours &gt;. Ahh than for this coming week they have me down for nearly everyday till closing time.	sadness	blog
14675	Hopefully tomorrow will go smoothe.	anticipation	blog
14676	Another little check-off on the to-do list, as all three of my summer classes are now done and graded, and I still retain my 4.0 GPA.	joy	blog
14677	It's a bit more satisfying this time than most since I'm now past the second of the three major problem classes I identified when I first got back into school.	joy	blog
14678	I assume until proven otherwise that I ought to be able to excel at the highest level at most things, so a top grade in all of my classes was always the goal from day 1.	anticipation	blog
14679	However, there are several things I know full well I've been between mediocre and bad at in the past- theoretical math, foreign languages, public speaking.	anger	blog
14680	Thus, Statistics, mandatory Spanish, and the public speaking class I've been in this summer were the three classes I've assumed were most likely to potentially drop my GPA.	sadness	blog
14681	So far that's turned out to be little problem- I believe I got perhaps 4 questions wrong over 5 or 6 tests in all of stats and secured an A easily in Speech.	joy	blog
14682	What's more, I could tell the subjects themselves were coming to me much easier than they did, say, 5 years ago- so it wasn't simply a matter of more lax evaluation.	noemotion	blog
14683	None of this is really an achievement of course, but it is nice to know that I seem to be improving in areas which were previously more difficult.	surprise	blog
14684	I dislike the idea of having gaps in my ability; it's the same need for balance that leads to me trying to further develop my natural cross-handedness into ambidexterity.	sadness	blog
14685	I've always been aware that I excelled verbally at potentially the highest level, and so I was best served by following and developing that side of my talents; but I refuse to allow that pursuit and development to leave me lopsided or with deficiencies in other areas.	noemotion	blog
14686	I have a month off of classes now, to do research and move and probably take up an internship job.	anticipation	blog
14687	I'm going to have to go out to south London area police station sometime tomorrow.	noemotion	blog
14688	The weather is looking so pleasant that I think the Tube will have to do do for transport.	joy	blog
14689	A little unfortunate, but at least it saves me from actually walking there.	surprise	blog
14690	If it hadn't been so important I'd have refused their invitation anyway- who's going to watch the shop while I'm gone.	noemotion	blog
14691	While I've got every faith in my employees abilities, I wouldn't like to think about what could happen if.	fear	blog
14692	I sent the last one that came around off with such a red face, it was a wonder he didn't pass out.	anger	blog
14693	It's good that I'm old enough to learn lessons on my own and not from others, either by teaching or example, because people are stupid.	disgust	blog
14694	Seven hours on the road in two days, and I've come to the conclusion that most people have no concept of what turn signals, speed limits, and restroom sinks are for.	disgust	blog
14695	I stopped in New Gloucester to use the bathroom on the turnpike, and had to wait because it was so busy.	noemotion	blog
14696	I saw one guy after another take a piss then leave without washing his hands.	disgust	blog
14697	Finally it was my turn, I use the facilities, go to the sink, find myself the only one there, and a constant line of guys behind me just filing out, again without using the sink.	disgust	blog
14698	There wasn't even a cursory, pretend wash amounting to little more than a cold water rinse.	noemotion	blog
14699	I finally snapped and yelled out the door at the last two DOES ANYONE WASH THEIR FRIGGING HANDS AFTER USING THE BATHROOM ANYMORE.	anger	blog
14700	Disgusted, I dried my hands, walked out, and yelled PIGS! toward the Burger King where a number of them had congregated for a late lunch.	disgust	blog
14701	While I have no doubt whatsoever that my equipment is clean and disease free I devote at least as much attention to cleaning that as I do my hands; any women dating these boys should be weary of the possible filth that probably accompanies sexual relations with him if he can't even take care of his hands, I cannot say the same for others, and cannot vouch for where their hands have been prior to touching the same surfaces that I have, such as the toilet seat, flush lever, and door handles.	disgust	blog
14702	Hey assholes, explain to your children where their cold sores came from: Daddy didn't wash his hands in the restroom, then he cleaned the ketchup off your face, and now you have herpes.	disgust	blog
14703	Old guy, while it's unlikely that you'll catch something major from a dirty turnpike restroom, even a case of the flu could kill at your age.	noemotion	blog
14704	UNCLEAN! should at the very least be a public restroom on the interstate.	disgust	blog
14705	Simply entering one should make you feel dirty and in want of a shower.	disgust	blog
14706	We saw Descent at the local 'ghetto' theater, in the local 'ghetto' mall.	noemotion	blog
14707	You know, it's like the Airport Mall here in Bangor: the automatic doors, for instance, aren't necessarily automatic anymore.	disgust	blog
14708	It makes me appreciate the local cinemas that much more, the former Hoyt's and even the cheap seats at Spotlight in Orono all have the new stadium seats, bigger screens, and latest sound tech.	disgust	blog
14709	But it was nice to get out to the movies with Holly, I don't get to see her very much at all in any role other than as mom, and as a single male with no kids, it's hard to associate myself with parents.	joy	blog
14710	Ask any comedian, they usually have a bit about the inability of the childless to relate to parents and vice versa.	noemotion	blog
14711	Not that Erin has a problem, she loves kids and works with them, but I've never honestly been much of a kid person.	noemotion	blog
14712	Older kids, sure, I can identify with short, immature but otherwise rational human beings, but little kids.	disgust	blog
14713	What do I do when someone three feet tall smacks me in the head.	anger	blog
14714	You can't beat them, you can't yell and foam at the mouth, but you can't ignore it either.	anger	blog
14715	But unlike that said territory, children grow-up at some point, and most at least realize that you can't just go around pissing people off.	anticipation	blog
14716	Though they undoubtedly do.	noemotion	blog
14717	The plot was just full of loopholes, there wasn't even any gratuitous boobage that you might otherwise associate with a Hollywood movie that stars an entire cast of nothing but athletic women.	disgust	blog
14718	No, these weren't the oh I'm cute, see my ta-tas? kind of athleticly built women, these were the see me hang from the roof of a cave by my fingernails type, the I don't even need a sportsbra kind of actual athletes.	surprise	blog
14719	But this one was just full of plot holes that you could drive a truck through.	disgust	blog
14720	IF you actually want to see The Descent then stop here and go do your nails or something.	disgust	blog
14721	Ok, so at one point they find a dead moose in the middle of the cave system.	noemotion	blog
14722	Oh they kill the food outside and bring it inside to eat.	noemotion	blog
14723	And what about the primitive cave paintings by the local natives thousands of years ago.	noemotion	blog
14724	I don't find the idea of poking around in the dark deep in the bowels of the earth very entertaining at all, I don't think our ancestors, devoid of electric flashlights and safety equipment would be any more inclined to risking their life for so worthless an enterprise.	disgust	blog
14725	Is there food that deep in the cave.	noemotion	blog
14726	If this took place in the wilds of Africa, perhaps it might be worth venturing into the earth to escape the large predators that prayed upon human beings so very long ago, but even that was well before we took to cave drawing.	noemotion	blog
14727	After the movie and the subsequent discussion as to all the different ways it was just simply retarded, we came back to the house and watched TiVo.	disgust	blog
14728	Holly's gotten really into Dog the Bounty Hunter and we watched an episode of that.	joy	blog
14729	It's alright, it's like American Choppers in that I enjoy it if there's really nothing else to watch.	joy	blog
14730	We also caught a couple episodes of that new Stan Lee show about the wanna-be super heros on SciFi.	noemotion	blog
14731	I'm already convinced that Feedback will win, he just looks the part of a modern comic book figure.	anticipation	blog
14732	Major Victory is entertaining, but he's got an old-school look to him, like the original Batman or Superman.	joy	blog
14733	Black suits for Spiderman and Superman for instance.	noemotion	blog
14734	Look at Superman: the original television Reeves was a fatman in tights with no issues, his movie successor had human flaws and frailties.	noemotion	blog
14735	An ordinary boy, with an ordinary name, but ordinary's just not good enough today.	sadness	blog
14736	We watch tube for a few hours, I watch Holly fold clothes, I head to bed in the basement then get up the next morning to watch Spiderman 2 with her and the kids.	noemotion	blog
14737	The turnpike was nuts, every asshole from Jersey and Connecticut was apparently heading to Canada.	anger	blog
14738	It was so packed that all three lanes were barely crawling along at the speed limit, let alone any faster.	disgust	blog
14739	At about Biddeford, I jumped-ship and headed up Route One, expecting an accident the likes of which I experienced the last time I headed home from NH by myself.	anticipation	blog
14740	Imagine: three lanes of traffic, none of it moving, for the better part of two hours.	anger	blog
14741	Come Scarborough, I jumped back on, since Route One was pretty packed, and I didn't want to go through downtown Portland.	noemotion	blog
14742	I abandoned the turnpike last time as well, shortly after the traffic jam cleared, and ended up getting home 4 hours later than expected and having just enough time to get ready for work before heading out again.	sadness	blog
14743	So back on the pike, putting up with traffic, speeds picked up to well above where they should have been, things cleared a little north of Lewiston, a little more above Augusta, but it was still pretty frigging busy all the way up.	anger	blog
14744	Got into Bangor, picked up my check, went home and waited for Erin.	noemotion	blog
14745	Spent some time with her, watched a little Storm of the Century on DVD the bargain bin rules, then took a nap before work, where I am now.	noemotion	blog
14746	The new guy is still training, and since he goes live on his own next weekend, he needs to ensure he can actually do the job on his own.	noemotion	blog
14747	Pete Rose runs over Indians catcher, Ray Fosse to score the winning run of the 1970 All Star Game.	noemotion	blog
14748	Fosse's career was never the same.	sadness	blog
14749	Yeah, cocky, supercilious Marco Starnoni who eats as if he had been walking in the desert feasting on nothing but manna for forty years.	disgust	blog
14750	We scored twelve runs in the 4th inning because of some shoddy defense by Marco's team.	joy	blog
14751	Let's just say they gave us at least five outs but probably more.	surprise	blog
14752	I had quite a few homeruns and was involved on the wrong side of a great defensive play turned in by Joe Twarogowski.	surprise	blog
14753	In the 3rd inning, I tried to score when a throw to third base got away.	noemotion	blog
14754	I came racing down the line as Ryan Shalek picked up the loose ball and fired a strike to home plate.	joy	blog
14755	Joey, who was blocking home plate, reached up and snared the ball as I arrived at the plate.	noemotion	blog
14756	I tucked my shoulder down and leveled a defenseless Joe.	noemotion	blog
14757	He went flying backwards and landed with a huge thud in the left-handed batter's box.	surprise	blog
14758	Upon hitting the ground, he pulled the ball out of his glove and into his bare hand and showed everyone he had held on to complete the double play.	noemotion	blog
14759	When I asked him whether he was all right, he said he was and proceeded to tell me that he knew it was coming.	noemotion	blog
14760	He saw the play unfolding but had no way to brace for it because of the high throw and the simultaneous arrival of me and the ball.	surprise	blog
14761	Oh well, how often does one see a collision at home plate anyway.	surprise	blog
14762	You just have to think though of the consequences when two people meet at one point in that vicious a nature.	anticipation	blog
14763	Who can forget Ray Fosse and Pete Rose's encounter at home plate in the 12th inning of the 1970 All Star Game.	joy	blog
14764	This play remains perdurably etched in baseball history as the greatest play at the plate of all time.	joy	blog
14765	Jim Hickman lines a base hit to center, Amos Otis comes up firing to the plate, the third base coach, Leo Durocher waves Pete Rose home, the throw brings then Indians' catcher, Ray Fosse a few feet up the line, and then it happens.	anticipation	blog
14766	Pete Rose knocks Ray Fosse into baseball lore and permanantly knocks his shoulder into a somewhat more precarious place.	joy	blog
14767	Pete Rose scores the game-winning run and Ray Fosse, the Indians' seemingly promising beacon, is never the same ball player.	joy	blog
14768	So, in the end, we held on to win by a score of 18-13.	joy	blog
14769	Joe was fine after taking one of the hardest shots any catcher has ever taken in the six years we've been playing ball together.	surprise	blog
14770	That is probably the reason most leagues have banned the runner from destroying the catcher like that.	noemotion	blog
14771	Yes, injuries can happen but, as a former catcher, it's the most exhilarating play in sports.	joy	blog
14772	There is nothing like being in a train wreck at home plate especially if you hang on to the ball for the out.	anticipation	blog
14773	Joe said it doesn't happen that often so it doesn't bother him.	noemotion	blog
14774	It would if it were a constant occurence but that was the first time this year that we had had a collision at home plate and probably the last.	noemotion	blog
14775	There is usually one good hit each season and that is it.	disgust	blog
14776	Joe said the only sensation going through his body when he hit the ground was that he had to go to the bathroom badly.	fear	blog
14777	Joe was on third and there was a runner on second with one out in a 6-6 tie in the bottom of the 6th inning.	noemotion	blog
14778	We were intentionally walking Ahsan to load the bases up.	noemotion	blog
14779	As I threw one of the pitches back to Billy, Joe broke for home plate.	noemotion	blog
14780	I screamed for Billy to throw it and he did.	anticipation	blog
14781	I jumped in front of home plate and the ball deflected off my glove and Joe just crushed me. He bounced off me and rolled behind home plate.	surprise	blog
14782	I turned around and swiped at Joe and missed as he hit home plate with his foot and his whole team just raced to the plate and mobbed him as they won, 7-6.	sadness	blog
14783	Ahsan says he still remembers that play.	noemotion	blog
14784	He says he and Joe knew we were loading the bases for their two worst hitters to get the game into extra innings so they devised a play that involved Joe's trying to steal home.	noemotion	blog
14785	Ahsan told me that he remembers the collision mostly because the game was being played in the rain and we very rarely play when it's raining.	noemotion	blog
14786	He saw us sprawled out on the ground and thought for sure Joe was out.	anticipation	blog
14787	Then he saw the ball lying on the ground and screamed for Joe to touch home.	anticipation	blog
14788	It was as if they had won the World Series.	joy	blog
14789	They completely mobbed Joe and were bounding around home plate as if Joe were the king of baseball.	joy	blog
14790	Good night my faithful blog acolytes.	noemotion	blog
14791	I shall catch you later on when I am feeling like writing again.	sadness	blog
14792	My brother and I just went out to go for a bike ride.	noemotion	blog
14793	I checked my bike tire, and though it was quite bent and warped, I was still able to go biking.	joy	blog
14794	The reason I was at the bank was to check to see if Dad had deposited the 56 dollar Government GST cheque into my account yet.	noemotion	blog
14795	So I went to take out my 60 dollars, and it said I couldn't take it, because my available funds was limited to 6 dollars.	anger	blog
14796	I was pretty bummed out, because it meant they put a hold on my cheque, I hate when they do that, what's the bloody point.	sadness	blog
14797	It wouldn't bother me much, except the last government cheque I deposited had no hold on it.	anger	blog
14798	It was 122 dollars money I promptly blew on DVD's and Food.	noemotion	blog
14799	So, here I am with money RIGHT there that I can't get a hold of, and I really want to spend it at the Furmeet on Monday.	anger	blog
14800	We furries are going to the Mongolian restaurant for a hangout from 7-9 before the meet, because sometimes we like to hang out and go bowling or swim for the meets.	joy	blog
14801	I get the feeling Dad doesn't want Sam to go weird on him.	anticipation	blog
14802	Like I said a while ago, Dad said he was gonna buy Sam a pound of weed, a 2-4 of beer, and a led Zeppelin album so that he had at least one normal kid.	noemotion	blog
14803	He's pretty old fashioned, but not rude about it.	noemotion	blog
14804	We think we're pretty close to letting Sam go with me but I would end up sleeping at Ixyao's again, because by the looks of it, Loth is spending the night in London again with his girlfriend.	noemotion	blog
14805	Earlier today, I put on Elfenking - Seasonspeech, and mom asked me if I ever listened to radio music anymore.	noemotion	blog
14806	Despite the large load of stuff he took, I barely notice a difference in the house.	noemotion	blog
14807	I've already told mom I'm moving on the weekend of the 26th, and I just need to get a hold of Andrea so I can make the plans formal.	anticipation	blog
14808	Now I need to find a place to put all my stuff at Andrea's. I know my DVD shelf would have no problem finding a place in the livingroom, but the computer, the bed, the dresser, and my electronics would need to find a home in my room.	anticipation	blog
14809	I could probably find a way to swing it, but it would be a little cramped.	noemotion	blog
14810	There's no way I could put my chairs there, and I don't want to trash em, I would like to give them to a friend or something at the least.	disgust	blog
14811	It took me a while to figure out how to do it, but I did finally figure it out, and I did what I could to keep Monday night and Tuesday morning open.	noemotion	blog
14812	That's funny, I think, that we love the furries so much that we're willing to schedule our schooling around the meets.	joy	blog
14813	However, when I went to submit my timetable, I was asked to pay the rest of my tuition.	surprise	blog
14814	as when I asked the representative, they said that as long as I paid my 400 dollars, I wouldn't have to worry about the rest of my costs until OSAP made a decision, and until then, I could go ahead, schedule, and do my thing.	joy	blog
14815	I need to make another few calls, but mom's in Norwich and has the only phone that works right now.	noemotion	blog
14816	It also said that I have to register for some student success thing, and I have to call in.	noemotion	blog
14817	Same deal, I have the number written down on a piece of paper so I don't forget when the time comes.	noemotion	blog
14818	I also have my MoCoMotion password and username right here, not to mention my OSAP access number, and all the numbers I need to call right here with me. I am PREPARED.	anticipation	blog
14819	And since I put that I was living with mother, and she only makes 6000 a year, I can almost guarantee that I will get accepted for OSAP, and they said they'll pay 8700 for this year.	anticipation	blog
14820	which is crazy good, especially if I'm living with Andrea, who only asks for internet, hydro, and food.	joy	blog
14821	For me, internet would be like 25 bucks, hydro, another 30 or 40, and food.	noemotion	blog
14822	well, I could splurge.	anticipation	blog
14823	I do have to pay something like 300 dollars a semester for the Mohawk Brantford to Mohawk Hamilton bus.	noemotion	blog
14824	And the government still owes me 680 dollars.	anger	blog
14825	and they say for this semester, I only owe them 1044.12.	noemotion	blog
14826	Yeah, vulgar, I know, but even if I had a friend with benefits, I would go the way of Andrea and do it to get it out of the way.	noemotion	blog
14827	I get to be ticket bitch, and I get more volunteer hours and experience.	joy	blog
14828	I need to have them ready so I can be looking for a job In Brantford after school.	anticipation	blog
14829	I am looking to drive more so I can get my G2, I am solid in my belief that I am going to Brantford on the 26th, I am no longer indecisive, I want to get away from the issue between my parents, and I am looking to be very assertive for college.	anticipation	blog
14830	#1, print off the OSAP thing the government wants me to.	noemotion	blog
14831	I just need it to get mom's signature, then I think I mail it to the government when they decide or something.	anticipation	blog
14832	After that, I then make my calls to mohawk to ask about the money issue, the tuition and my schedules.	noemotion	blog
14833	#4, move to Andreas and get comfortable there while looking for an after school job.	noemotion	blog
14834	#5 talk to the people concerning the shuttlebus from Brantford to Mohawk.	noemotion	blog
14835	Problem is, I can't do any of these things right now, so I keep them all in mind, and become impatient to get access to a phone, and I am gonna look up info on the shuttlebus.	noemotion	blog
14836	Courses just opened up, so it's not like I'm late, they've been open for a whole 12 hours, and I can register until mid September, so I've got some time, however, I don't want to wait, that's why I went on the site this morning to do it ASAP.	anticipation	blog
14837	I have the choice to either go to this Burgessville Rocks thing, go to London to watch movies with the Furries, or go to Brantford with Jason to sling some haybales and make some more cash oh yeah, Tim owes me like 30 bucks too, on top of the 60 in my bank so apparently I do well with the cash.	noemotion	blog
14838	I will be okay until I move to Andreas, and for a little while afterwards, I'm in no rush, but I want to be ahead of the crowd.	noemotion	blog
14839	I know I CAN do it, I just want college, that's my thing.	anticipation	blog
14840	Anyway, the smart part of me says to go to Jason's, make some cash, get stronger, get ready and train my leg to be stronger like I did on my bike.	noemotion	blog
14841	However, the loyal part of me says that since I made a promise to Whit, even though it's unpaid work, I should go to Burgessville.	trust	blog
14842	I mean, I told her on July 25th, or somewhere around there, that I'd come help out, and I wasn't backing out this time.	noemotion	blog
14843	Plus I get to see Whit, Sam, Will, and the whole High School Crew.	joy	blog
14844	I miss em all and they're the smartest, most responsible group I've ever been a part of.	trust	blog
14845	However, the playful, devil-may-care part of me tells me to fuck em all and go to London to watch movies with the Furs.	noemotion	blog
14846	In fact, I sent her an email, and she still hasn't responded, so I don't know when she'll be here.	noemotion	blog
14847	Not flamboyant Homosexuals, but people on message boards and forums.	noemotion	blog
14848	People like a guy I know named Pisher, and Kuellere.	noemotion	blog
14849	Rondoze, I think I see the source of our misunderstanding.	noemotion	blog
14850	It's a defensible opinion, however unproven.	noemotion	blog
14851	So sorry to have misunderstand you, it would help if you learned how to write.	anger	blog
14852	People like him bug me, not because they disagree with me, but because when you disagree with them, they resort to insults, and we all know how men need to have big balls and can't lose to another man, people always fall into a fight, or as it's known online, a flame war.	disgust	blog
14853	I try to stay out of them, as I can't stand my intelligence being lowered to their level, but sometimes I just want to do what Jay and Silent Bob did.	disgust	blog
14854	go to their houses and smash their faces in because they like to aggravate.	anger	blog
14855	When I go on a messageboard about movies, I like discussing things like which film was better, Pirates or Superman.	anticipation	blog
14856	I personally enjoyed Pirates more, but I thought Superman was far more artistically done with a fantastic story.	joy	blog
14857	Whereas you go on there, on one side there are people constantly saying that pirates sucked, and that nobody is allowed to like it because it sucked and it was horrible.	disgust	blog
14858	etc. or you have the folks trying to tell you that Superman was horrible.	surprise	blog
14859	despite the fact that it made nearly 200 million dollars.	noemotion	blog
14860	It's disgusting that I have to feel relieved when I find a thread that has people calmly discussing sides of an argument.	disgust	blog
14861	Well, I'm gonna go post on a board and try to ignore the flames.	noemotion	blog
14862	In case I don't see you, good afternoon, good evening, and goodnight.	noemotion	blog
14863	i dont know what i want outta life.	noemotion	blog
14864	i dont like myself    quite frankly i dislike myself very much, dont ask why cause i couldnt tell you.	sadness	blog
14865	im only writing this stuff down because when i see it in writing sometime i understand myself better.	noemotion	blog
14866	i hate the word better.	disgust	blog
14867	but wat the HECK  does delight yourself in the Lord and He will give you the desires of your heart, mean.	noemotion	blog
14868	i feel like i constantly need a boyfriend.	sadness	blog
14869	i cant learn to be ok with myself alone and i dont want to have to rely on boys to make me feel like im important or worth living.	sadness	blog
14870	just giggle giggle giggle thats all they do everyday all day and all they need is a boyfriend and someone to laugh with.	joy	blog
14871	Terrorists make me SICK, they ought to all be horrifically detained, I believe it was the first time in my life I have had to resort to extreme racism.	disgust	blog
14872	Perhaps I am just being petty, but that did really annoy me.  It absolutely outrages me as to how evil, and canniving these people are.	disgust	blog
14873	Imagine, transporting a bomb, fashioned out of a SPORTS DRINK, and triggering it with the simplistic flash of a disposable camera.	noemotion	blog
14874	I just can't believe it.	surprise	blog
14875	I'm only going back now, should a member of my immediate family pass away.	sadness	blog
14876	Britain, has, evidently officially gone to the dogs if the so-called prime minister is in Mexico, whilst we could have been dealing with 3,500 innocent lives lost, on 10 different jetliners.	disgust	blog
14877	Lat night, while trying to demonstrate to Tequila Boy how effectlivley I could beat him up if he ever had a complete change of personality and decided to attack me I slipped on the carpet trying to demonstrate a roundhouse kick fell backwards and hit the wall with what I'm assured was a sickening crack.	anger	blog
14878	But it didn't hurt and it didn't seem to be bleeding to much so I shrugged ot off and went to bed.	surprise	blog
14879	Now I'm on my political soapbox, so if you find opposition to the Republican regime distasteful, feel free to exit now.	disgust	blog
14880	On a more serious note, just open up any paper or online news provider and you will find things that *should* alarm you, and which definitely are bothering me! Here is just an example from Yahoo News:.	fear	blog
14881	WASHINGTON - While the British terror suspects were hatching their plot, the Bush administration was quietly seeking permission to divert $6 million that was supposed to be spent this year developing new homeland explosives detection technology.	fear	blog
14882	We have spent billions of dollars and countless human capital expenditure on the whole Homeland Security division.	noemotion	blog
14883	We diverted funds from FEMA for this organization which, in my mind, was directly and I mean DIRECTLY tied to the disaster Katrina brought to the South.	disgust	blog
14884	That does not even begin to address the loss of our civil liberties and the insidious spread of a Gestapo or KGB-like mentality that most of America just seems to be blissfully unaware of.	disgust	blog
14885	The government can and WILL find you no matter what steps you take to try and get some privacy.	anger	blog
14886	Perhaps I'm being an alarmist, but the loss of privacy and personal freedom in the name of security SCARES me. I am fine with heightened security at airports.	fear	blog
14887	In fact, last night my Mom asked me if I am scared of flying and going on our trip.	fear	blog
14888	Honestly, I think it means that we will be SAFER for the next few months traveling.	trust	blog
14889	It's the pervasive spread of Big Brother Is Watching You that concerns me. Some people say we only have to put up with this for two more years while I say, Get me a job in Canada.	fear	blog
14890	Two wrongs can make a right in small situations.	noemotion	blog
14891	One such being the slight civil annoyance of another commuter's feet riding pride high on the train seats.	disgust	blog
14892	Often only concerned in self removal in busy or peak times.	noemotion	blog
14893	Sadly, due to current legal mud pies, forcefully conveying the issues and negatives concerned with sitting in such a state are verboten.	sadness	blog
14894	Knowing the majority's aversion to confrontations and speaking out, a ride with the feet up on the seats can usually last the entirety of a journey.	disgust	blog
14895	For those who feel powerless and fearful of repercussions, yet want to take action, there is always something more grating than knowing someone either cannot read or show respect for public seating areas.	disgust	blog
14896	Away from view and made to be the problem of another set of commuters.	disgust	blog
14897	As, after all, society has been developed to shift blame and anger ad infinitum.	disgust	blog
14898	Thank God the exam's over.	joy	blog
14899	Some questions wasn't even discussed.	noemotion	blog
14900	Plus, that theories and galaxies.	noemotion	blog
14901	i come home after two weeks and our place is fucking disgusting.	disgust	blog
14902	girlfriends and random sex junk mail and all.	noemotion	blog
14903	i didn't even get a jolt when i saw her face on comments.	noemotion	blog
14904	i still have moments and all, natrually.	noemotion	blog
14905	but i guess when you let it all go, and you realize it's time to move on and all.	sadness	blog
14906	when you come to terms with letting it go.	sadness	blog
14907	we're down to the final weeks of summer people.	anticipation	blog
14908	I hate it when certain people always seem to be better at me in everything they do.	disgust	blog
14909	even though I know inside that I could beat them at most aspects of all that.	anticipation	blog
14910	I guess I'm not going to continue with this any more.	disgust	blog
14911	I hope everything will be all right in time to come.	anticipation	blog
14912	My brain seems dead and most probably won't be able to keep up with everything else that I'm sure is going to be thrown at me. If people's minds could be weirded out.	sadness	blog
14913	The last time I watched them so close up was back when I was still a young child.	joy	blog
14914	I gave in to temptation.	joy	blog

14928	Playing love and politic are alike, you have to say the words without really say them and make sure the opposite party get the impressions you want them to see.	noemotion	blog
14929	And for some reasons I dislike doing politic cause manipulating, mostly people, are what it does.	anger	blog

14949	lets just say i never want to drive a manual car again.	disgust	blog
14950	It's not like much has happened since last year.	noemotion	blog
14951	I feel more at ease now that I kind of know what I want to do with my life, but more scared because I feel like everyone is a step ahead of me. I have to admit though school has me freaked out about my future.	fear	blog
14952	What if nothing goes as planned and I can't get a job and I'm stuck doing something that I hate.	fear	blog
14953	Today I exchanged numbers with a girl in my class so we can study for our Midterm.	joy	blog

14961	My mother was there for me the whole time while I was scared to death, losing consciousnes, and fearing for my life, and I will always remember that.	fear	blog
14962	The goal was to go to sleep and never wake up, but after taking 32 of those dreadful cold pills that put scars on my kidney in the first place, death was becomming all too real too fast.	sadness	blog
14963	Have you ever wanted to be with someone that is a friend of the other sex but you are afraid to ask that person.	fear	blog

14966	I had a really nice conversation with Juckett, another amazing one with Phil, and then another one with Solomon.	joy	blog
14967	It was definitely a good night of conversation, although I did stay up until 12:30, and I payed for that this morning in 1st period Physics.	joy	blog
14968	But all of a sudden today it's hit me that I have all this work due.	fear	blog
14969	I have so much long-term work that I'm not sure if I'll get it all finished with band practice every night, a football game friday, and a competition all day Saturday.	sadness	blog
14970	But, tonight I'm attempting to get a good portion of it finished.	noemotion	blog
14971	I'm starting my argument on illegal immigration which I may say is turning out fantastic with the first two praragraphs I have, and I finished one of my US History charts, and I plan on outlining a bit once I start watching America's Next Top Model.	joy	blog

14976	Don't be afraid to weigh in on the subject.	noemotion	blog
14977	I turned the channel to ESPN because the DirectTv satellite guide said NFL Live was on.	anticipation	blog
14978	Instead of NFL Live, I get Barry Zito of the Oakland A's rambling on about somebody who just died.	disgust	blog
14979	I'm sorry someone died, but to mislead me like that is inexcusable.	anger	blog
14980	Don't be afraid to weigh in on the subject.	fear	blog
14981	even though i wasnt in the right mood, a.k.a : my mind was in portland, it was  a really good flick.	joy	blog
14982	it was one of the movies i was told to watch.	noemotion	blog

14984	she stopped talking about it, started mumbling about porcaline and what time she has to start the bisk.	noemotion	blog
14985	i dont want her to think that i will never take her suggestions as useful or necessary, because i cant say that wont happen.	noemotion	blog
14986	how much would you pay for your safe haven.	noemotion	blog
14987	the key bank woman reassured me that the BRINKS people, when they find cards that dont belong to key bank, shred up the cards.	trust	blog
14988	what i was worried about, someone trying to steal money off my card, isnt going to happen.	fear	blog
14989	and anything she says, no matter how sweet the voice is is nasty and mean spirited.	disgust	blog
14990	and me with my explaining skills wont show her how what she just said stung.	sadness	blog
14991	i get stuck, cant think of the right term and lose my train of thought.	sadness	blog
14992	thus getting myself more pissed and less willing to finish what i was just trying to say.	anger	blog
14993	and i end up doing what she says because i cant get over the fact i stumbled in a sentence 5 minutes prior.	sadness	blog
14994	i cant wait to visit portland again, though right now i dont think ill be able to go back until i have payed rent.	anticipation	blog
14995	but if it takes 2 weeks for me to get a pay check and the first week of work is counted into the next two weeks anyway.	noemotion	blog
14996	so really my first pay check will be in 3 weeks and i cant afford to be late with rent.	fear	blog
14997	i might have to borrow from mom, since ive payed her off, but then shell know i dont have any of the money left and.	fear	blog
14998	but im more worried about losing the one i love, even though i cant have her right now.	fear	blog
14999	i know this is cheesy and maybe pointless but i am going to say it anyway.	noemotion	blog
15000	I went to the dentist today was some fillings and instead I got a root canal.	surprise	blog
15001	First they gave me a swab to numb my gums, then two shots.	noemotion	blog
15002	Then they fucked around with my teeth, which never hurt except for the clamp, but I was on edge, because it felt like it was about to hurt, like any moment they might hit a nerve.	anger	blog
15003	so the nurse was doing suction, and she accidently hit the rubber sheath across my mouth isolating the tooth which made a very loud noise in my ear, so I flinched, and the dentist was like It's not big deal, show her it's nothing to be afraid of so she did it again and I really freaked out, really flinched and even cried out and then I starting crying.	surprise	blog
15004	Anyway it wasn't too bad, except they didn't do any fillings, so I still have a loser mouth.	sadness	blog
15005	as unexpectedly and elusively as the innernets appear, SO DO THEY STOP DISAPEAR.	surprise	blog
15006	so hi, friends, it is me, and i'm in my sweatpants and barefoot.	noemotion	blog

15015	she's living at home with her parents now and she's not feeling very good about herself.	sadness	blog

15019	He had wanted to call either Yohji or Schuldig last night, but Deguchi had kept him busy attending a ball, not returning home until three in the morning.	noemotion	blog
15020	Brad had promptly fallen asleep, having been up at dawn to make it across the island for the deal that morning.	noemotion	blog
15021	At least they hadn't needed to be anywhere until lunch this morning.	noemotion	blog
15022	And Deguchi didn't have another social function planned until tomorrow night.	surprise	blog
15023	It was merely golf all day tomorrow and then the party that night.	noemotion	blog
15024	And Brad couldn't wait to get home.	anticipation	blog
15025	But in the meantime, he had free time, as Deguchi was passed out in his room from too much liquor and too little sleep and the desire to be as perky as possible for his golf game tomorrow.	noemotion	blog
15026	It was a pleasant Tuesday evening in Hawai'i, Wednesday at home, Brad reminded himself automatically, and he had the doors to the balcony open wide and was sitting on the lone chair looking out over the ocean.	noemotion	blog
15027	He just hoped that Yohji had time to talk.	noemotion	blog
15028	I didn't go to Speech this morning because there was nothing else for me to turn in.	sadness	blog
15029	Instead, I went shopping for sandals to wear to graduation.	noemotion	blog
15030	In Drawing, we played Ms. Wolf's Fun Game.	noemotion	blog
15031	Even Aaron played, although he hadn't signed up.	noemotion	blog
15032	The Fun Game itself involved cardboard boxes with mystery items in them and our job was to decorate the boxes any way we wanted.	joy	blog
15033	When it came time to trade boxes and open them, people kept avoiding mine because it left blue paint all over anyone who touched it.	sadness	blog
15034	Pacheco asked if he could put some on me and he painted me up like a cat, with green-and-purple whiskers and a smudgy pink heart for the tip of my nose.	noemotion	blog
15035	He asked if I could help make him up like a clown, and then the two of us painted Ryan's face like a hooker.	joy	blog
15036	I was laughing up at Josh Bloomfield and Peter, when someone spoke softly behind me, very fast.	joy	blog
15037	I wanted to wipe the green-and-purple whiskers off with my hands, but was afraid of making it worse, so I didn't do anything.	noemotion	blog
15038	Ryan was kind of standing on the outside of the group, which makes sense, I guess.	noemotion	blog
15039	As Mink turned from his locker and slid through the crowd, Ryan watched him go.	noemotion	blog
15040	And - you know Leif Carlson? - me and Leif sat together and that guy shows up late on the first day of class and he was at our same table.	noemotion	blog
15041	He - you know, he had that big coat, and his hair was all shiny and slicked back - and he doesn't smile - so, we just thought. Ryan waved his hands abruptly to show what it was they thought.	noemotion	blog
15042	When I am really actually honest, I'm just as superficial as anybody else.	noemotion	blog
15043	They cause tears to run down my cheeks and make me want to fall to my knees.	sadness	blog
15044	Backing out of that driveway getting further and further away from you was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.	sadness	blog
15045	I'm so scared that everytime that I see you it's going to be my last time and I never want to leave your side.	fear	blog
15046	my quilt is finally coming along though i am alsorts of excited.	joy	blog
15047	anyways i wont b here all weekend i will b in penn state with a bunch of male bleeders and my brother laughing out loud so there ttyl byes.	anticipation	blog
15048	But when you want money for people with minds that hate.	noemotion	blog
15049	But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao.	noemotion	blog
15050	As long as capitalism reigns in America, the gulf between the haves and the have-nots will widen until it is an insurmountable chasm filled with the broken bodies of whipped slaves.	disgust	blog
15051	What will it take to rise above and leave this human ashtray that we've been snubbed into.	disgust	blog
15052	It will take an exit from the current, compromised system.	noemotion	blog
15053	Words and phrases like terrorist, anti-semitic, anti-war, Islamo-fascist, protest and communist.	noemotion	blog
15054	That last one alone has been responsible for more fear-mongering than the presently seated Bush administration has been able to muster in the past six years, and that's a pretty tall order.	disgust	blog
15055	The BOO! machine runs full-time at the White House these days.	anger	blog
15056	What's interesting about their motivations is that most of what we're supposed to be afraid of is actually simply informative alternatives to the status quo: the fear of change.	fear	blog
15057	The government wants us to be afraid of terrorists so that they can pass more questionable legislation that makes it easier to control us.	fear	blog
15058	They want us to not criticize the Zionists who give the Jews a bad name, because of how much Zionists influence U.S. foriegn policy in the name of Israel.	noemotion	blog
15059	They want us to be scared of protesting and dissenting in the name of freedom, because there are more of us than there are of THEM.	fear	blog
15060	I even suggest that the government has always wished us to be afraid of communism, because it goes against the very thing that government relies upon to keep it rolling: capitalism.	noemotion	blog
15061	From the Red Scare and the Communist witch-hunt of the 50's with Senator Joe McCarthy aggressively pursuing perceived threats to the safety and security of America, to the current fear and loathing of so-called communist countries such as North Korea, Cuba and China, actual communism has never, ever existed.	disgust	blog
15062	Dictators like Fidel Castro and Kim Jong Il oversee police-states, but aren't purveyors of actual communism as espoused by Marx.	disgust	blog
15063	Like other socialists, Marx and Engels sought an end to capitalism and the systems which they perceived to be responsible for the exploitation of workers.	noemotion	blog
15064	But whereas earlier socialists often favored longer-term social reform, Marx and Engels believed that popular revolution was all but inevitable, and the only path to socialism.	noemotion	blog
15065	Even within so-called modern communism, there are many splits and factions, notably between Marxist/Leninist communists and anarchists.	noemotion	blog
15066	I was led, through an interesting internet surfing session, to a full-on philosophical debate between members of these two camps in which it appears as though the Leninist scored a numbing defeat.	noemotion	blog
15067	While perusing the pages detailing the battle of words, I ran across a detailed look at just what the revolution might look like, if it truly indeed ever happened.	noemotion	blog
15068	For that matter, it looks as if it could be happening right now, no matter what -ism you slap it with.	noemotion	blog
15069	And it makes pretty clear the idea that the continuation of this charade of voting booths and elected officials is never going to turn America around and make it the Utopia that many hope it will become; unless the people get serious about organizing and ceasing this selfish, alienating style of life that we cling to.	disgust	blog
15070	The very act of revolution demands a will stronger than Dancing With The Stars, Cribs and the latest incarnation of CSI.	noemotion	blog
15071	We are a nation of air-conditioned, drive-thru frequenting, automatic can-opener using, processed meat-eating, hands-free restroom-using workers.	disgust	blog
15072	We live to work, but work is not our collective life.	noemotion	blog
15073	We work because the system demands that we operate the machinery.	noemotion	blog
15074	Only after we have been put through the schools, which teach us not to think for ourselves or question what we're taught, only after we're encouraged to seek higher learning in order to make the highest dollar, do we then enter a life-long engagement in a vocation that keeps us away from the things we actually wish to do.	sadness	blog
15075	The dream that you can fight hard and work to get ahead, put money away and eventually leave the factory of human flesh, at age 65, to finally live what's left of your shriveled life, aided by the promise of a Social Security plan that our dear leader, the Decider is actually trying to privatize, just like our national banking system.	disgust	blog
15076	The dollar buys a nickel's worth; banks are going bust; shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter; punks are running wild in the street, and there's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do, and there's no end to it.	disgust	blog
15077	We know the air is unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat.	sadness	blog
15078	And we sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us that today we had fifteen homicides and sixty-three violent crimes, as if that's the way it's supposed to be.	sadness	blog
15079	We sit in the house, and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller, and all we say is, Please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms.	disgust	blog
15080	Well, I'm not going to leave you alone.	anger	blog
15081	I don't want you to write to your Congressman, because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write.	noemotion	blog
15082	I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street.	sadness	blog
15083	and I'm not going to take this anymore.	anger	blog
15084	Just at the mere thought of the source of longing makes you want to cry, to sob out the truth of your heart.	sadness	blog
15085	Longing is not for the faint of heart, but longing will make you weak in the heart.	joy	blog
15086	I volunteered at a store once but that was about it.	noemotion	blog
15087	I was more tired because I was used to sleeping in until like 10 but now I have to wake up at 7.	noemotion	blog
15088	The only thing is where I work is a tax law firm place and I don't know any of the terms so I'm learning as I go.	noemotion	blog
15089	Luckily I don't have to do much with numbers cause I deal mostly with the phone, oh and did I mention they don't mind if we're on AIM, check our e-mail, or look up random stuff online as long as we get our work done.	joy	blog
15090	Oh and my mentor, she's Catholic and she teaches CCD so me and her get along pretty good.	joy	blog
15091	Well I guess we'll see what happens later with my job.	anticipation	blog
15092	I won't pay attention in class and miss assignments, I'm always afraid I'm going to forget to do something or something's gonna spring up on me and AAAAAAH.	fear	blog
15093	It just feels like my brain has ceased to function.	noemotion	blog
15094	Or like there like, fluff in it instead of a brain.	noemotion	blog
15095	I can't pay attention, I can't think straight, I can't even talk.	fear	blog
15096	People will be talking and I'll want to join in on the conversation but I won't have anything to SAY so when I do say something it's last minute and flustered and everybody looks at me like.	fear	blog
15097	' and continues talking to someone else.	noemotion	blog
15098	Today, I was pulled out of a meeting by our building manager, who was in a blind panic.	noemotion	blog
15099	The problem turned out to be that I needed to choose a paint color for the walls of the new office space.	noemotion	blog
15100	This was apparently an emergency.	surprise	blog
15101	Why yes, I have in fact spent the rest of the day imagining paint-based emergencies.	other	blog
15102	Nurse, a can of the #47 crocus blue satin finish.	noemotion	blog
15103	Anyway, we tracked down the paint chip sample brochure buried on the receptionist's desk, and I pulled out my carpet samples, preparing to face my daunting choice--which turned out to be between two nearly identical shades of office off-white.	noemotion	blog
15104	I went with the slightly more creamy white, rather than the slightly more grey white.	noemotion	blog
15105	The other is appalling crap: disorganized, blatantly pseudoscientific, and misogynistic.	disgust	blog
15106	The pseudoscience could probably be blamed at least in part on its late-70s vintage - maybe things like multiple personality disorder and schizophrenia were so poorly understood and poorly approached at the time that this gobbledegook was passable or else maybe these disorders were so poorly understood that they were as hokey to established science as poltergeists.	noemotion	blog
15107	I suppose attitudes towards women have changed a lot too, but this was so awful I threw up my hands and returned the book before leaving the library.	disgust	blog
15108	He goes on to describe her in later years as unhappily married, fat, and sullen.	disgust	blog
15109	The result is that all of his comments about the sexual energy of any of his mostly female, mostly pubescent subjects come out with a kind of leer behind them.	disgust	blog
15110	It wasn't performed by Lionel Ritchie this time, but by Faith No More.	noemotion	blog
15111	There's currently a commercial on rotation, I advertising what capitalistic piece of crap it is this time, but it is a terrible, terrible, cover of In a Big Country.	disgust	blog
15112	I also heard somewhere that the song was covered by Dashboard Confessional.	noemotion	blog
15113	I see this commercial every morning; it is an omen for a very bad day.	disgust	blog
15114	We have all had or are still having, perhaps for the rest of our lives our encounters with stupid people, but it's the ones who just won't stop bothering you that are among some of the worst.	disgust	blog
15115	Somebody fucking invited me to a Facebook group called Sally is cooler than your mom.	anger	blog
15116	Okay, if you're going to be cooler than anyone, saying that you're cooler than my mom is a fucking given.	noemotion	blog
15117	But then again, even my mom is greater than Sally.	disgust	blog
15118	Three angry customers; as a matter of fact, that last week alone at Pier 1 was the only week where I met troublesome customers.	anger	blog
15119	Very odd and peculiar.	surprise	blog
15120	Some chick named Monica called and asked if I could work.	noemotion	blog
15121	Oh I know, the kids who are voted Best Dressed in school.	noemotion	blog
15122	Isn't it aggravating when someone is practically demanding you to hang out with them.	anger	blog
15123	Sure, it's nice to see people wanting to be within your presence, but when they step over the line and enter the realm of stupidity, self-esteem issues and denial of self-being, well then I want to do nothing but kick you in the fucking baby maker.	disgust	blog
15124	But a video like that has to be stuck in there somewhere.	noemotion	blog
15125	The closest to the origanal is Panic!s cover on This is Halloween.	noemotion	blog
15126	That is probably a good thing.	joy	blog
15127	I am never totally sure who is reading people who don't have time or inclination to comment.	noemotion	blog
15128	or maybe there is nothing worth comment upon?and that influences what I share, too.	noemotion	blog
15129	I tend to have great ideas about commentary about midday, and don't get around to blogging until later and the mood has passed.	sadness	blog
15130	I struggle with the Catholic concept of baptism being a gift we give infants because it is God's gift to us.	noemotion	blog
15131	Having the girls baptized is not something I will regret, as I plan to raise them cognizant of and faithful to the faith.	trust	blog
15132	They can always choose not to go to church.	noemotion	blog
15133	And maybe having been baptized Catholic, they will come back to the church.	noemotion	blog
15134	I an not afraid of having lots of children.	joy	blog
15135	I am not afraid of having another child.	anticipation	blog
15136	I just know having another one right now would cause great havoc in the tender new environment that Dave and I have with the girls now.	fear	blog
15137	And God provided all sorts of opportunities for us to use knowledge in regard to family planning.	noemotion	blog
15138	The next time I actually get you on the phone when you're not atired bnot in the mood or cjust plain not wanting to talk to me please don't elect to watch a movie instead of having a conversation with me. It's these types of choices that make it hard for me to justify trying to be your friend.	sadness	blog
15139	Me: Yah uh, I was with about 12 other people ready to watch a movie we were supposed to start an hour before for a class, Kinda already planned.	anticipation	blog
15140	It's those types of choices that make it hard for me to justify a friendship.	sadness	blog
15141	first let me say, this is one of the stupidest fucking reasons to be once again pissy with someone.	anger	blog
15142	Ive noticed an abundance are usually about me, and rather stupid.	disgust	blog
15143	every once in awhile one or two titles will catch my eye and I will read it, but for the most part i really am sick and tired to stupid repetitive shit.	disgust	blog
15144	Not to mention the same learning experiences and new discoveries or opinionated ideas towards me that always seem to change week to week, so whatever.	anger	blog
15145	i attempted to have a normal conversation with him, and apparently my basic human right to hang up whenever I choose to do so, Is not allowed.	disgust	blog
15146	Court was intimidating but I did good.	surprise	blog
15147	Traffic court is uh, a lot more serious than I thought.	surprise	blog
15148	And It got ruled that it was my vehicles fault not mine, and the I got minimum sentence possible for my ticket.	noemotion	blog
15149	The results: Careless Driving required when you hydroplane and 2 points on my driving record and 60 dollar fine.	noemotion	blog
15150	No biggy, but it was not angled no popped tire and the smoke was dark black, I know that's not normal.	noemotion	blog
15151	This kid was in the back seat with the door open and his leg hanging out.	joy	blog
15152	I walked up to him Whats going on, you need some help.	anticipation	blog
15153	So i Told him it was on fire I dont think he heard me, So i grabbed his smeater and yanked him out of the car, he stumbled back, dropped his shit and looked at me pissed what the fuck lady we got about four or five steps from the vehicle when the gas tanked popped not a hollywood explosion here people and burning gas flew out everywhere, catching the grass on fire, blowing out both rear tires and because the door was open, the interior of the vehicle started going up in flames.	surprise	blog
15154	after some silence from the driver his attitude changed and hes like thanks that could have been me and repeated oh my god while I got an ETA on police and fire from dispatch and gave her information.	surprise	blog
15155	The news people showed up, talked to the kid and he pointed at me while I was telling the cop I had to go, because i really did not want to be late, and I left.	noemotion	blog
15156	after though I was thinking about it, it would have been kinda cool to get interviewed for pulling him out.	sadness	blog
15157	I remain anonymous in the newspaper and life goes on.	noemotion	blog
15158	but If it was more discrete, and people only saw the car in the ditch, or only saw me take out the sign, how long would it have taken someone to stop.	noemotion	blog
15159	People drive by this stuff everyday, I think I look at it differently because of my experiences and the department, so I stop.	noemotion	blog
15160	And I want to go to buffalo wild wings with Jen.	noemotion	blog
15161	the speedometer broke on my way down, but it decided to fix itself.	noemotion	blog
15162	But uncle beeve saved the day and fixed a bunch of stuff for me. Called it an early Birthday present, he is so amazing.	joy	blog
15163	Than i drove to lake wood around familiar routes to try and get my confidence back with driving.	joy	blog
15164	While I was in lakewood I surprised Brian and we met Scooty for lunch, suprised him too.	surprise	blog
15165	Just what I needed to collect myself and continue home.	joy	blog
15166	Novmber 11th is the next time i will for sure be there for the weekend, I have courtney and im coming down early to stay at scotts.	anticipation	blog
15167	He does not know this yet, I need to call him this week.	noemotion	blog
15168	I can't wait to go on a night drive with Brian and just chill out there for awhile.	anticipation	blog
15169	But Maria does not want me too, so Paul came in for me. My finger needs to get better faster.	anticipation	blog
15170	So, Im going out with some friends later, do some homework, both our work uniforms are dirty all of them so I think I might do laundry, and make our bed.	noemotion	blog
15171	Im going to mail grandma a letter tonight.	joy	blog
15172	They both just lost their husbands and Vegas grandma has had more time, were hoping she will help Canada grandma feel better.	sadness	blog
15173	I am so proud of my sister.	joy	blog
15174	I can't relate to 99% of humanity.	disgust	blog
15175	After watching the middle-aged geeky character, Seymour Steve Buscemi in Ghost World, I can't but help agreeing with him.	joy	blog
15176	Okay, I can relate to more than 1% of humanity, but lately I don't like it's more than 25%.	disgust	blog
15177	And not even that I can't relate, or try to.	noemotion	blog
15178	And I don't mean don't fit in in a sort of sad-emo-subculture-wearing black all the time thing.	noemotion	blog
15179	What also started me thinking like this is the whole dating issue.	noemotion	blog
15180	There is a type and he's very elusive.	noemotion	blog
15181	But, back to reasons that I don't relate to *74%* of humanity:.	sadness	blog
15182	I don't think that the place to meet a potential love interest is at a party.	noemotion	blog
15183	And you know what kind I mean, because parties in general are okay, but I mean drunken ragers and the like.	noemotion	blog
15184	I don't think it's okay to display women provocatively everywhere just to sell a product.	disgust	blog
15185	I am, quite honestly, furious and they WILL be getting an angry letter from me, even though won't care, I'm sure because as much as they would like you to think that they aren't part of the machine they are.	anger	blog
15186	Go ahead, care about the environment, but don't care about demeaning women.	disgust	blog
15187	I don't like the movie Top Gun.	disgust	blog
15188	I don't think money buys happiness.	noemotion	blog
15189	I don't think sex begets happiness.	noemotion	blog
15190	I actually take notice of nice days, smells, etc. and appreciate it, appreciate the luxuriousness of things like that and let it effect me.  I don't just trample it in my Uggs.	joy	blog
15191	I try not to listen to rap because it perpetuates stereotypes.	disgust	blog
15192	Nor do I continually inflect the ends of my sentences upwards.	noemotion	blog
15193	People are just rude and selfish, and I know I'm victim too, but I don't want to be like that.	disgust	blog
15194	I get the feeling that a lot of people want to be like that.	noemotion	blog
15195	It's part of getting older, and that sounds cliched, that makes me realize that I'm not a fan of the typical college girl thing.	noemotion	blog
15196	Its not my bag and I don't really even want to be around it.	disgust	blog
15197	What is so wrong about REMEMBERING the weekend.	anger	blog
15198	When are people going to step it up and join humanity.	disgust	blog
15199	or at least the percentage I can deal with.	noemotion	blog
15200	And where are the intelligent, attractive, respectful guys who aren't frat boys, who just wear jeans and t-shirts and $30 tennis shoes, who like to read and watch movies.	noemotion	blog
15201	And who have some sense of style but are still kind of dorky but have social skills.	noemotion	blog
15202	So I kept walking straight, and the dog that crossed the street turned around and saw me and growled, I was like  oh shit Jorge, just keep walking.	fear	blog
15203	So i did, and then the second dog growls at me too, and Im like  Should I run or keep walking.	fear	blog
15204	So I kept walking and then the other dog that crossed the street comes back running at me and I said OHH SHIT.	fear	blog
15205	And I saw a house with the gate door opened slightly, and i squeezed in there sumhow sumway.	noemotion	blog
15206	I knoe im skinny but DAMN.	surprise	blog
15207	So yeah, i stayed in that house for like three minutes then i got up and checked to see if the dogs were gone, and they were, so i tried squeezing out the same way I squeezed in but I didnt fit, so i just opened the door and left.	fear	blog
15208	Just remember, in the winter, far beneath the bitter snow,.	noemotion	blog
15209	It's the second stanza that caught my attention; more specifically, it's those two first lines: It's the heart afraid of breaking that never learns to dance./It's the dream afraid of waking that never takes the chance.	joy	blog
15210	There is a prospect, and I think I am going to go for him.	anticipation	blog
15211	Nothing grand, mind you; this is one that must be handled with a delicate touch: nothing rash, nothing rushed let it flow.	trust	blog
15212	I have considered the possibility for a while now, but I have been apprehensive, and I did not act on what I felt.	sadness	blog
15213	And then, just the other day, I was driving down 470 on the way to college, listening to 105.5, and a beautiful song came on that I had not heard before.	surprise	blog
15214	Naturally, it took a few lines to catch my attention, and I began to pay attention just as those two lines were being sung by Ms. Middler.	joy	blog
15215	The words made me think Now I have thought, and thought, and you who know me best will not be surprised that I thought some more.	noemotion	blog
15216	I did an SAT Lit practice test on each bus ride, because I am cool, and I did better than I expected.	surprise	blog
15217	The staff is currently in the process of archiving every one of these 30-45 second clips ever made, so I spent almost all day going through them.	noemotion	blog
15218	I had to listen to each fully and make note of any audio or labelling defects and whether there was an advertisement at the end.	anticipation	blog
15219	At first I thought that someone had inexplicably decided to RV in the middle of Broadway, but a man with a French accent told me it was for a Will Smith movie.	surprise	blog
15220	I love the two guys who work at that Starbucks - they're awesomely flamboyant and they told me about how Cameron Diaz came in for a latte during their shift last week but without Justin.	joy	blog
15221	I didn't see Will Smith although the French Prince is usually my shit, I think I would have had to punch him on behalf of everyone who's heard Switch, but the girl on the elevator with me said she had just randomly seen Mike Myers.	anger	blog
15222	That afternoon - *gulp* - Lawler came to observe me. When I heard she was coming, I spazzed, afraid that she might have an issue with the fact that I never, you know, handed in any of my internship forms.	fear	blog
15223	Of course, as soon as she came in, John came over and said, You realize, Molly, that you're not allowed visitors, and we will have to give you thirty more lashes.	noemotion	blog
15224	Then she proceeded to call me Meghan** and went through the required but hilariously inapplicable hazardous chemicals/safety concerns set of questions while the interns around me tried to stifle their laughter.	joy	blog
15225	I'm pretty sure you can see him during The Onion segment in The Aristocrats.	noemotion	blog
15226	I got a call this morning asking me to come in for an interview today at 1:30pm.	anticipation	blog
15227	When I got there, I went in and told them I was there and waited.	noemotion	blog
15228	I was called in and 2 guys interviewed me. I was completely honest throughout the interview from telling them about the handcuff story with Danika to the dirty joke story when I was working at the movie theatre.	trust	blog
15229	At one point I apologized for being so nervous and they told me that there were people a lot worse and that I wasn't using the words uh and um as often as others had been.	surprise	blog
15230	They told me that they would set me up for the next interview by calling me in the next day or 2.	anticipation	blog
15231	The next interview is with the general manager of the store, it will likely take place on Saturday.	anticipation	blog
15232	The 2 interviewing me were thinking of placing me in digital imaging due to my background with photography and video editing, I told them that it would likely turn out to be too easy for me in the long run and that I was hoping for a position more challenging so that I could learn more overall.	noemotion	blog
15233	I said that I want to work in the TV department as I want to learn more about them.	anticipation	blog
15234	Where they will decide to place me is up to them, as long as I get the job, I'll be really happy.	anticipation	blog
15235	Oh, if I get a job at Futureshop, It looks like I would be starting there around November 8th.	noemotion	blog

15237	Saturday: Hopefully the interview at futureshop.	anticipation	blog

15239	That one chick I dislike with a passion because I think she is obsessed with Gareth and really likes him.	anger	blog
15240	I never would do that, but I had to because I was speculating about the whole thing.	noemotion	blog
15241	and I was freak it.	noemotion	blog
15242	when I got home I was really nervous I hadn't talk to Gareth for 2 days because of college.	fear	blog
15243	So I tell him it took me FOREVER To tell him but i was shakey and nervous to.	fear	blog
15244	Then he said that he's not worried about her taking him away from me.	anticipation	blog
15245	He's like yeah he would wait a couple of weeks and delete her.	anger	blog
15246	And I hate these mistakes I do.	disgust	blog
15247	all i can say in my defense is that whatever they're thinking isn't true.	noemotion	blog

15313	So Adam and I went to App State to go hiking.	noemotion	blog
15314	When they were together everyone was equal.	noemotion	blog
15315	Which was such a contrast when compared to the small group I belonged to.	noemotion	blog
15316	There were also other various events that I ended up doing on my own, due to the lack of interest from others in my group.	noemotion	blog
15317	Everyone has been given a gift in life.	noemotion	blog
15318	My son.	noemotion	blog

15339	So, to the task.	noemotion	blog
15340	Well.	noemotion	blog
15341	So he just took his backpack with him and came on my tour.	noemotion	blog
15342	While in London I also saw Coriolanus at the Globe Theater.	noemotion	blog
15343	Especially the British Museum.	noemotion	blog
15344	Soooo many monuments, including two statues in front of Buckingham Palace that had a conspicuous Communist message.	noemotion	blog
15345	It was a worker with a hammer and a peasant woman with a sickle situated behind Queen Victoria's back , and glowering at the palace.	noemotion	blog
15346	Now maybe I was just reading too much into this, or maybe I had spent too much time in the eastern bloc talking about Communist symbolism.	noemotion	blog
15347	But I don't' think so.	noemotion	blog
15348	So.	noemotion	blog
15349	I ended up doing tours out there for the duration of the summer.	noemotion	blog
15350	Now add a couple of poorly placed ancient columns.	noemotion	blog
15351	But two days back to back was more than enough.	noemotion	blog
15352	Just FYI.	noemotion	blog
15353	They also bake bread for you on the plane so that your in flight meal is fresh.	noemotion	blog
15354	And they weren't kidding.	noemotion	blog
15355	What's more, we had the whole place to ourselves.	noemotion	blog
15356	But not feta.	noemotion	blog
15357	Haloumi.	noemotion	blog
15358	Haloumi has nothing to do with Feta.	noemotion	blog
15359	People say London or Paris is expensive; no.	noemotion	blog
15360	Zurich is expensive.	noemotion	blog
15361	But we didn't let that discourage us.	noemotion	blog
15362	After our detox detour en Suisse, we headed via night train to Paris.	noemotion	blog
15363	And people are out in them all the time.	noemotion	blog
15364	So we went across the street to the park, it was about 2:00 pm.	noemotion	blog
15365	There were people all over the place, and lots of benches and chairs.	noemotion	blog
15366	Well, when in Rome.	noemotion	blog
15367	so we did the same.	noemotion	blog
15368	Had a little hour sleep, got back up and headed back into the colossal Louvre for another few hours.	noemotion	blog
15369	Thus, is my two year Grande Tour at an end.	noemotion	blog
15370	The last few weeks I've been in Lubbock, trying to readjust to life in America and spending lots of time with my family.	noemotion	blog
15371	There was �a lot to pack in.	noemotion	blog
15372	I'll be in New York for New Year's, so if you're going to be in that area, let me know and we'll ring it in together.	noemotion	blog

15380	I have looked forward to this year even before last year ended.	noemotion	blog
15381	This is the year when I get to test myself: my mind, my body, and myself.	noemotion	blog

15446	This is my update for today and I am off.	noemotion	blog
15447	It's the veils.	noemotion	blog
15448	Listen.	noemotion	blog
15449	Let's clarify.	noemotion	blog
15450	Taleban style if you will.	noemotion	blog
15451	Hijab in Islam actually means modesty or privacy.	noemotion	blog
15452	The khimar is the actual headscarf.	noemotion	blog
15453	Not the ban on hijabs.	noemotion	blog
15454	But if the UK Muslims are listening to Mr. Livingstone, he's on to something.	noemotion	blog
15455	So the voluntary and involuntary.	noemotion	blog
15456	Turkey has a similar issue.	noemotion	blog
15457	The hijab is accepted and tolerated, as are the nikab wearers which is an extremely small percentage of Muslim women.	noemotion	blog
15458	This door has to swing both ways.	noemotion	blog
15459	We all need to take the veils off.	noemotion	blog
15460	and look at each other eye to eye.	noemotion	blog
15461	our individual pages are under the members section.	noemotion	blog
15462	Take care of each other.	noemotion	blog
15463	Brandon's dad, Michael, is improving.	noemotion	blog
15464	Hey, how has everyone been lately.	noemotion	blog
15465	It's been a while.	noemotion	blog
15466	and there has been so much going on.	noemotion	blog
15467	and it's been just a big jumble of AWOIWEJFPWKSFWEIONMQMEM.	noemotion	blog
15468	Especially people.	noemotion	blog
15469	Anyway, this past week has been one of the busiest ones yet for me, and maybe for you too.	noemotion	blog
15470	Sometimes, all we need is that little encouragement or motivation to get us going again.	noemotion	blog
15471	Okay that's about it for now.	noemotion	blog
15472	I asked the sub if he did not mind my taking over, and of course he complied.	noemotion	blog
15473	So the bell rang, the sub introduced himself and I took over.	noemotion	blog
15474	I allowed them 10-15 minutes to finish up the work from yesterday before we began a new piece of literature.	noemotion	blog
15475	After they turned that in, I introduced Poor Richard's Almanac, which we read as a class.	noemotion	blog
15476	That was a segway into today's story.	noemotion	blog
15477	Today we read, The Talk by Gary Soto.	noemotion	blog
15478	I gave a brief background on the author and the story before we began.	noemotion	blog
15479	At the end of the story, I had them do the same thing they did with my paragraph to determine the mood.	noemotion	blog
15480	After a discussion, I asked them to take out a piece of paper.	noemotion	blog
15481	I'm the libero tracker.	noemotion	blog
15482	x.x I need to invest in a pair of blades.	noemotion	blog
15483	o___x.	noemotion	blog
15484	Stephenie Meyer.	noemotion	blog
15485	What can I say.	noemotion	blog
15486	Meyer, JK Rowling, and Meg Cabot.	noemotion	blog
15487	And yes, I read hundreds, thousands of books from other people.	noemotion	blog
15488	But these female writes.	noemotion	blog
15489	I'm a writer.	noemotion	blog
15490	I know that.	noemotion	blog
15491	I'm enough of a grown-up to say it.	noemotion	blog
15492	how they can take over her outlines.	noemotion	blog
15493	And Stephenie says that we should know our characters.	noemotion	blog
15494	I can tell.	noemotion	blog
15495	hm.	noemotion	blog
15496	You know you're from Massachusetts when.	noemotion	blog

15507	You're aware that there is a town, somewhere in Massachusetts, named Brimfield where they have the biggest outdoor antique market in the world.	noemotion	blog
15508	You keep an ice scraper and can of de-icer on the floor of your car.	noemotion	blog
15509	There are moments in our lives when we find ourselves at a crossroad.	noemotion	blog
15510	The choices we make in these moments can define the rest of our days.	noemotion	blog
15511	But once in a while, people push on.	noemotion	blog
15512	And it's only when you're tested that you discover who you can be.	noemotion	blog
15513	I have no details.	noemotion	blog

15591	my life has been somewhat conventional:.	noemotion	blog

15607	you know why.	noemotion	blog
15608	now.	noemotion	blog
15609	because, i know.	noemotion	blog
15610	not so much.	noemotion	blog
15611	but basically my mind will stray to one mantra.	noemotion	blog
15612	Well, actually, I have to be, BUT.	noemotion	blog
15613	'I'm not recieving the paper.	noemotion	blog
15614	but I sent in a check 3 weeks ago.	noemotion	blog

15617	So.	noemotion	blog
15618	I ask Robbye, knowledge of all things Ann Arbor News.	noemotion	blog
15619	But really, Ive only had the job a few weeks.	noemotion	blog
15620	So, no cubicle job for life for me.	noemotion	blog
15621	I saw Phil.	noemotion	blog
15622	I went to Sheldon's house.	noemotion	blog
15623	Sheldon, Phil, Daniel, and I.	noemotion	blog
15624	I tried to control myself.	noemotion	blog
15625	His hair, his eyes, his dimples.	noemotion	blog
15626	He has a new eye brow piercing.	noemotion	blog
15627	It suits him.	noemotion	blog
15628	But he did.	noemotion	blog
15629	Because he knew I needed the reaction.	noemotion	blog
15630	And really, he kind of did.	noemotion	blog
15631	And I didn't try to touch him.	noemotion	blog
15632	No.	noemotion	blog
15633	And that it's him now.	noemotion	blog
15634	Are you okay?, He asked.	noemotion	blog
15635	Yeah, I'm going to go home.	noemotion	blog
15636	No, I'm going to go.	noemotion	blog
15637	Why.	noemotion	blog
15638	Is it really that hard to tell.	noemotion	blog
15639	i had a lot of time to myself in the car which i used.	noemotion	blog
15640	I went to her house a couple days ago and kind of figured we'd easily be back together, but there seem to be a number of things in the way.	noemotion	blog
15641	It'll turn out one way or another.	noemotion	blog
15642	Bah.	noemotion	blog
15643	As always.	noemotion	blog
15644	Yeah.	noemotion	blog
15645	Oh well.	noemotion	blog

15656	The sole stipulation: Do your time first.	noemotion	blog

15663	I don't know what to do.	noemotion	blog
15664	It's not over.	noemotion	blog
15665	Apparently, it was not Wayne alone who was misled.	noemotion	blog
15666	The rest of the troop that he was sent with thought they were only going for 12 months.	noemotion	blog
15667	Now, they don't know yet when that will be, but I don't care.	noemotion	blog
15668	It has been 4 days since her milk dropped and they are supposed to have the pups after 5.	noemotion	blog

15731	You know that Baywatch running style from that tv program.	noemotion	blog
15732	o.O Took a photo of him, he was a bit far though.	noemotion	blog
15733	I totally zone out.	noemotion	blog
15734	We went to Anri's house for cake and coffee.	noemotion	blog
15735	Hmmm.	noemotion	blog
15736	We sat there 'trying to decide' what we are going to do.	noemotion	blog
15737	We almost sat there for an hour.	noemotion	blog
15738	That was as clear as daylight.	noemotion	blog
15739	Hm.	noemotion	blog
15740	what do you pick.	noemotion	blog
15741	:p.	noemotion	blog
15742	They went to the movies afterwards.	noemotion	blog
15743	Ye.	noemotion	blog
15744	I am too tired now.	noemotion	blog
15745	will finish later.	noemotion	blog
15746	Would you be careful and try to preserve every moment you have left.	noemotion	blog
15747	So I tried to step out of myself for a minute and look at things the way he may have been viewing them.	noemotion	blog
15748	An athelete.	noemotion	blog
15749	You are virtually unstoppable.	noemotion	blog
15750	So what do you do.	noemotion	blog
15751	First, because I could already piece together the backdrop of the story.	noemotion	blog
15752	So what would you do.	noemotion	blog
15753	and everyone thats home is so wrapped up with their own stuff ///dudes//women.	noemotion	blog
15754	alfkjaslkjfasjflka;sjdf;asjfals;fjlakjsf.	noemotion	blog
15755	im done talking about it.	noemotion	blog
15756	for many reasons.	noemotion	blog
15757	nothing hereee.	noemotion	blog
15758	myrtle/3.	noemotion	blog
15759	but nobody else is for moving out as much as i am.	noemotion	blog
15760	all my substitute information is in.	noemotion	blog
15761	if i can get a job at taylors.	noemotion	blog
15762	and i can get a new car.	noemotion	blog
15763	fags.	noemotion	blog
15764	the way you look at me.	noemotion	blog

15767	Well, well, well.	noemotion	blog
15768	So, drop by and tell me what all of you are up to.	noemotion	blog
15769	Granted, not the global, world-issues Big Picture, just MY Big Picture.	noemotion	blog
15770	it was not self-determined.	noemotion	blog
15771	How do I do that.	noemotion	blog
15772	So anyway.	noemotion	blog
15773	Ritual.	noemotion	blog
15774	Rut.	noemotion	blog
15775	* Every other Saturday, Catharine and I get manicures and pedicures.	noemotion	blog
15776	I've just realized in trying to make a list of my rituals, that I really don't have many.	noemotion	blog
15777	How very telling.	noemotion	blog
15778	Always.	noemotion	blog
15779	and.	noemotion	blog
15780	Is that a rut.	noemotion	blog
15781	or just something totally mental that I do.	noemotion	blog
15782	How do you think we can instill more meaningful rituals into our lives.	noemotion	blog
15783	From talking with cartoonists, I get the sense that most of them find it debilitating, too.	noemotion	blog
15784	There were no signs to direct you to the panels or whatnot, though it wasn't hard to find someone to ask direction of.	noemotion	blog
15785	It was a hotel, on a road.	noemotion	blog
15786	I went to two panels, Scott McCloud's and Brian Chippendale's.	noemotion	blog
15787	BOOKS I GOT:.	noemotion	blog
15788	House of Twelve, at the movies Vol.	noemotion	blog
15789	R.	noemotion	blog
15790	Do you know some tiger sharks sleep.	noemotion	blog
15791	I think it's in the Gulf of Mexico or the Gulf of California, I can't remember which, but there's so much oxygen in the water they actually sleep.	noemotion	blog
15792	I don't sleep.	noemotion	blog
15793	I just lay in the bed next to them while they snore, or they breathe softly, or they dream, or they do whatever it is sleeping people do.	noemotion	blog
15794	Most of the time, I sit in a chair.	noemotion	blog
15795	Sometimes, I can't reading about this condition, though.	noemotion	blog
15796	When I was a kid I slept.	noemotion	blog
15797	I think.	noemotion	blog
15798	They really do when there's no end.	noemotion	blog
15799	I think I do.	noemotion	blog
15800	It is, isn't it.	noemotion	blog
15801	I actually keep one everywhere, one in my car, one in each room of my apartment, one in my cubicle.	noemotion	blog
15802	How else would I keep all these days straight.	noemotion	blog
15803	I can't always read about this condition, or whatever it may be.	noemotion	blog
15804	I'm beginning to think there may be nothing to it.	noemotion	blog
15805	Otherwise, I'm a totally healthy male of my species.	noemotion	blog
15806	Something from when I was a kid.	noemotion	blog
15807	I don't know where that came from.	noemotion	blog
15808	I can drink and drink.	noemotion	blog
15809	Most times, I can't even remember what I did five seconds ago.	noemotion	blog
15810	Doesn't require much of a brain to do it.	noemotion	blog
15811	Have you ever read it.	noemotion	blog
15812	I kept having to reread passages until I figured out that it's not chronological.	noemotion	blog
15813	I think he had a point.	noemotion	blog
15814	But I can't remember it right now.	noemotion	blog
15815	I'm at work, and I left the book at home.	noemotion	blog
15816	I'll have to look when I get home.	noemotion	blog
15817	Unless I returned it to the library.	noemotion	blog
15818	I walk to work.	noemotion	blog
15819	When it's nice.	noemotion	blog
15820	It's a couple miles, but I don't have a lot of people that I have to rush home to see.	noemotion	blog
15821	Just my books these days.	noemotion	blog
15822	My walk takes me by Lake Calhoun.	noemotion	blog
15823	Most days I look at it as I pass by the fishers, the runners, the dog walkers.	noemotion	blog
15824	Every so often, I walk around it.	noemotion	blog
15825	I don't know what it is about the lake.	noemotion	blog
15826	I itch my neck for some reason it itches.	noemotion	blog
15827	I don't get it.	noemotion	blog
15828	I amble around the lake, and the people are slowly thinning out.	noemotion	blog
15829	I should have brought a book with me. Then I could read at the lake.	noemotion	blog
15830	People tell me that the water in the lakes around here isn't that good.	noemotion	blog
15831	And there are plenty of fish.	noemotion	blog
15832	I control it at first.	noemotion	blog
15833	I think.	noemotion	blog
15834	But where else would I know it from.	noemotion	blog
15835	Vardaman is right.	noemotion	blog
15836	I can see people running at me as I dive into Calhoun.	noemotion	blog
15837	I read somewhere that fish don't sleep.	noemotion	blog
15838	Except for some tiger sharks.	noemotion	blog
15839	can I borrow.	noemotion	blog
15840	December 1st.	noemotion	blog
15841	Must.keep.eyes.on.prize.	noemotion	blog
15842	So.	noemotion	blog
15843	It's nice kind of being able to put everything together in my head.	noemotion	blog
15844	Anyways, I'm not sure there's anything else I can add that hasn't been said over and over.	noemotion	blog
15845	Now I'm just trying to take everything one day at a time.	noemotion	blog
15846	Okay, off to clean this room.	noemotion	blog
15847	i took Shelby again.	noemotion	blog
15848	she was raring to go.	noemotion	blog
15849	back at the car, T had Shelby all wrapped up in a towel to warm her.	noemotion	blog
15850	i ran with Smiley this past Wednesday; he was just released no one came to claim him and allowed to go for a run.	noemotion	blog
15851	This was the cake.	noemotion	blog
15852	He turned 4.	noemotion	blog
15853	Just as he was about to blow out his cake.	noemotion	blog
15854	and I tore up the cake.	noemotion	blog
15855	At Work:.	noemotion	blog
15856	This is one of my co-workers grandson.	noemotion	blog

15874	As we walked.	noemotion	blog
15875	and walked some more.	noemotion	blog
15876	and even more.	noemotion	blog
15877	Then we met him.	noemotion	blog
15878	because they have a snazzy sign.	noemotion	blog
15879	This was after we finished a 6 mile walk.	noemotion	blog
15880	Check out the look on Christina's face.	noemotion	blog
15881	I saw Kathy Vu during the walk.	noemotion	blog
15882	Afterwards, we went out to eat with other peoples at Pizza My Heart.	noemotion	blog
15883	Check out little dao's face.	noemotion	blog
15884	and then meet the nox.	noemotion	blog
15885	I stand barefoot by the ocean's edge, my feet sinking slowly, being sucked beneath the surface of the cool, wet sand.	noemotion	blog
15886	I am planted there.	noemotion	blog
15887	Head tilted back.	noemotion	blog
15888	Well here we are again at the conclusion of another all too fleeting weekend.	noemotion	blog
15889	I used to have it all done by Halloween so maybe I'll return to that tradition.	noemotion	blog
15890	Right now we're on a train traveling from Rome to Florence.	noemotion	blog
15891	We'll sightsee there and then take another train to Venice in the evening.	noemotion	blog
15892	From there it's on to Switzerland and then France.	noemotion	blog
15893	On Friday we saw the Coliseum, the Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, the Spanish Steps, Palatine Hill, Villa Medici, Trinita dei Monti, Piazza del Popolo and much more.	noemotion	blog
15894	Yesterday Saturday was spent at Vatican City.	noemotion	blog
15895	Ah well.	noemotion	blog
15896	There was so much to look at, I just couldn't take it all in.	noemotion	blog
15897	At all.	noemotion	blog
15898	Ah well.	noemotion	blog
15899	You meet a lot of neat people at hostels.	noemotion	blog
15900	There is a pizzeria and gelateria on every corner.	noemotion	blog
15901	keep in mind my bed is lofted about 4.5 ft. high and i was hungover after having slept 4 hours.	noemotion	blog
15902	i'm too lazy to pick it up.	noemotion	blog
15903	are you okay.	noemotion	blog
15904	yeah.	noemotion	blog
15905	so i made a martini.	noemotion	blog

15908	but yeah.	noemotion	blog
15909	say.	noemotion	blog
15910	it hummed.	noemotion	blog
15911	Sunday afternoon, Erica, Diana, and I are going to the Spy Museum.	noemotion	blog
15912	On the first floor, they have a crawlspace you can go through.	noemotion	blog
15913	It's carpeted, so not too hard on the knees, and I see that someone left behind their brochure.	noemotion	blog
15914	Diana finds a book, and Erica picks up some souvenirs for her family.	noemotion	blog
15915	So, we finished the group work and I decided just to head home.	noemotion	blog
15916	Plus.	noemotion	blog
15917	well as normal as it can be.	noemotion	blog
15918	*whispers* especially if I factor Matt into the mix.	noemotion	blog
15919	I decided to get my annual supply of contacts with the knowledge if I did I could get a free webcam and a $30 rebate.	noemotion	blog
15920	The total came to $218.92, but it's worth it.	noemotion	blog
15921	So, I stayed at the YMCA for about 2 hours and went home to my little bird.	noemotion	blog
15922	I took out the webcam from Shopko and entered the program into my computer.	noemotion	blog
15923	It's actually something I thought about alot and I did stay dressed up for it.	noemotion	blog
15924	I mean.	noemotion	blog

15930	Something strong.	noemotion	blog
15931	What I really meant to say.	noemotion	blog
15932	You could see me stand on my own again.	noemotion	blog
15933	Cause now i can see.	noemotion	blog
15934	Locked inside of me so deep.	noemotion	blog
15935	It always seems to get to me.	noemotion	blog
15936	So many things you should have known.	noemotion	blog
15937	Claudio Montiverdi was one of the most prominent composers of this era.	noemotion	blog

15970	Dear Marketplace:.	noemotion	blog
15971	I'm an avid listener of the programme.	noemotion	blog

15973	*The ones in control of it*.	noemotion	blog
15974	Look into it.	noemotion	blog
15975	There's no reason to encourage them ok, us.	noemotion	blog
15976	Maybe it's time to add one more weapon to the arsenal.	noemotion	blog
15977	Maybe it isn't.	noemotion	blog
15978	This is how the redcoats see the world.	noemotion	blog
15979	Then Holy Joe ripped this one out:.	noemotion	blog
15980	Joe, you're scraping.	noemotion	blog
15981	You're turning redcoat.	noemotion	blog

15997	Alright, we're about to eat dinner, so until next time.	noemotion	blog
15998	It hasn't been very eventful in any way.	noemotion	blog
15999	Besides Hitler.	noemotion	blog
16000	or George Bush.	noemotion	blog
16001	That's what I think.	noemotion	blog
16002	i dont even know.	noemotion	blog
16003	anyways.	noemotion	blog
16004	i'm out.	noemotion	blog
16005	Later.	noemotion	blog
16006	Hey.	noemotion	blog
16007	I was studying 4 my CT3.	noemotion	blog
16008	Anyway, a few weeks ago, I visited a chinese tea house and ate mooncakes and proper tea and tea eggs.	noemotion	blog
16009	I had rockwall enrichment yesterday.	noemotion	blog
16010	Well I'll try to write more often.	noemotion	blog
16011	I'm being trained by this woman, her name is Judy.	noemotion	blog
16012	at the end of today my drawer was exact again.	noemotion	blog
16013	Buh byeee.	noemotion	blog
16014	It's why I try to hone my body as I do my mind.	noemotion	blog
16015	Life keeps moving.	noemotion	blog
16016	All told about a dozen guys, and I was the only one who actually washed his hands.	noemotion	blog
16017	Some were in the middle of eating, others were holding girl's hands or their children.	noemotion	blog
16018	I didn't see much of Michael, he had to work during the day, then Holly and I skipped out to see a movie and left him with the kids.	noemotion	blog
16019	The theater itself hasn't been updated since approximately ET was first released.	noemotion	blog
16020	How did it get there.	noemotion	blog
16021	Umm-kay, I can see that.	noemotion	blog
16022	But on each side of this cavern, there are drop-offs of hundreds of feet that had to be traversed by clinging to the ceiling.	noemotion	blog
16023	No floor.	noemotion	blog
16024	Is your first thought well, must find a way across.	noemotion	blog
16025	What about the tiny passages you'd have to squeeze through.	noemotion	blog
16026	What's the point.	noemotion	blog
16027	Fresh water.	noemotion	blog
16028	Safety.	noemotion	blog
16029	So what's the point.	noemotion	blog
16030	Comics and subsequent spin-off media such as movies reflect the point I'm making: the whole shebang has gotten darker, both literally and figuratively.	noemotion	blog
16031	Yea ok, so I don't know what this has to do with the refrain, but it's a catchy tune.	noemotion	blog
16032	Then I head home around lunch time.	noemotion	blog
16033	How can I blog so extensively at work.	noemotion	blog
16034	Sniff.	noemotion	blog
16035	Nick------1---0---1---12--2---2----18.	noemotion	blog
16036	Marco----2---2---1---1---7---0----13.	noemotion	blog
16037	Well, it was an all right game.	noemotion	blog
16038	The inning would just never end.	noemotion	blog
16039	It's not as if Joe has never gotten me before.	noemotion	blog
16040	I remember it as though it were yesterday.	noemotion	blog
16041	June 5th, 2003.	noemotion	blog
16042	I landed by the ball and picked it up with my bare hand.	noemotion	blog
16043	What I did, to see, was check to see what my balance was.	noemotion	blog
16044	It was 62 dollars, that's precisely 56 dollars more than I had.	noemotion	blog
16045	The place looks just as full as it did when he was living here.	noemotion	blog
16046	I also tried to do my timetable, today was the first day I can set the timetable.	noemotion	blog
16047	That way I can go to the Furmeets, Jason also did the same thing, he has Mondays off so he can go to the furmeet.	noemotion	blog
16048	Sam and I are both working for Burgessville Rocks for Whitney.	noemotion	blog
16049	Alphabeta for two years, and now this.	noemotion	blog
16050	Try to tell me that it's not impressive to see on a resume.	noemotion	blog
16051	Which I should print up next week, when I find the time, after I get the info.	noemotion	blog
16052	None of that for the Runa.	noemotion	blog
16053	Here's a list of the things I need to do.	noemotion	blog
16054	I need to do that ASAP.	noemotion	blog
16055	Not to mention the 680.	noemotion	blog
16056	Flamers.	noemotion	blog
16057	Both are people who go on the Boxofficemojo forums.	noemotion	blog
16058	Just as an example, here's something he wrote.	noemotion	blog
16059	just because they can.	noemotion	blog
16060	so im confuzed.	noemotion	blog
16061	or even enough of those.	noemotion	blog
16062	For ages now I've been doing this self defence class and at the beginning of every class we get a stern talking too about not doing any of this stuff at home, and I've just discovered why.	noemotion	blog
16063	So now I have five staples in the back of my head.	noemotion	blog
16064	Click here for full story.	noemotion	blog
16065	Plausibility deniable.	noemotion	blog
16066	This works in their favour.	noemotion	blog
