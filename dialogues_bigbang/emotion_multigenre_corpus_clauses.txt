25069	10070_1	  It might not be 1970s animation , 	disgust	moviereview
25070	10070_2	  but everything else about it is straight from the Saturday morning cartoons -- a retread story , bad writing , 	disgust	moviereview

15830	10071_1	 whether it wants to be an acidic all-male All About Eve or a lush  	noemotion	moviereview

25072	10073_1	  Gorgeous to look at 	joy	moviereview

15896	10074_1	 than The Simpsons ever has  	joy	moviereview
15915	10074_2	 It looks much more like a cartoon in the end 	disgust	moviereview
15937	10075_1	 since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent  	disgust	moviereview
15980	10075_3	 With a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work , especially 	disgust	moviereview
16023	10075_5	 but as is , Personal Velocity seems to be idling in neutral .  	disgust	moviereview

25075	10077_1	  It 's better suited for the history or biography channel , 	disgust	moviereview
25076	10077_2	  but there 's no arguing the tone of the movie - it leaves a bad taste in your mouth 	disgust	moviereview
25077	10077_3	  and questions on your mind . 	disgust	moviereview
16045	10078_1	 that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots  	disgust	moviereview
16068	10078_2	 An entertainment so in love with its overinflated mythology 	disgust	moviereview

21712	10080_2	  and obvious fashion . 	disgust	moviereview
8459	10081_1	It 's surprisingly bland despite the heavy doses of weird performances and direction .	disgust	moviereview
16090	10082_1	 that its tagline should be  	disgust	moviereview

21716	10090_1	  The movie has generic virtues , 	disgust	moviereview
21717	10090_2	  and despite a lot of involved talent , seems done by the numbers . 	disgust	moviereview

16275	10092_1	 to watch  	noemotion	moviereview
16297	10092_2	 It 's a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful 	disgust	moviereview

2342	10096_1	There 's a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age/coming-out tale .	disgust	moviereview
16361	10097_1	 As much as I laughed throughout the movie  	joy	moviereview
16383	10097_2	 although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys ' superhuman capacity to withstand pain  	joy	moviereview
16425	10097_4	 , I can not mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment , or even performance art , 	disgust	moviereview

21723	10100_2	  and a recycled 	disgust	moviereview
21724	10100_3	  and dumbed-down version of Love Story . 	disgust	moviereview

17821	10166_2	 is a matter of plumbing arrangements and mind games , of no erotic or sensuous charge .  	disgust	moviereview

21829	10438_1	  Little more than a super-sized infomercial for the cable-sports channel 	disgust	moviereview
21830	10438_2	  and its Summer X Games . 	disgust	moviereview
13253	10439_1	 that often becomes laughably unbearable when it is n't merely offensive  	disgust	moviereview
13275	10439_2	 A generic bloodbath 	disgust	moviereview
7756	1043_1	 This is n't a narrative film 	noemotion	moviereview
7757	1043_2	 I do n't know if it 's possible to make a narrative film about September 11th ,	noemotion	moviereview
7758	1043_3	 though I 'm sure some will try  -- but it 's as close as anyone has dared to come . 	noemotion	moviereview
2403	10440_1	Julie Davis is the Kathie Lee Gifford of film directors , sadly proving once again ego does n't always go hand in hand with talent .	disgust	moviereview
13296	10441_1	 that if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape , it must be labelled ` hip ' , ` innovative ' and ` realistic '  	disgust	moviereview
13318	10441_2	 An unholy mess , driven by the pathetic idea 	disgust	moviereview
21831	10442_1	  The story 's pathetic 	disgust	moviereview
21832	10442_2	  and the gags are puerile . . 	disgust	moviereview
13338	10443_1	 because it does n't have enough vices to merit its 103-minute length  	disgust	moviereview
13361	10443_2	 Curiously , Super Troopers suffers 	disgust	moviereview
13384	10444_1	 that it might as well have been titled Generic Jennifer Lopez Romantic Comedy  	disgust	moviereview

2404	10447_1	I still want my money back .	anger	moviereview
13427	10448_1	 that its `` dead wife communicating from beyond the grave '' framework is even remotely new or interesting  	disgust	moviereview
13448	10448_2	 It plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption 	disgust	moviereview
13468	10449_1	 that a relationship like Holly and Marina 's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom  	disgust	moviereview
13491	10449_2	 as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive  	disgust	moviereview
13512	10449_3	 It 's hard to believe 	surprise	moviereview

7759	1044_1	 My oh my , 	joy	moviereview
7760	1044_2	 is this an invigorating , electric movie . 	joy	moviereview
13554	10450_1	 that was old when ` Angels With Dirty Faces ' appeared in 1938  	disgust	moviereview
13577	10450_2	 All too familiar ... basically the sort of cautionary tale 	disgust	moviereview
4503	10451_1	... passable enough for a shoot-out in the o.k. court house of life type of flick .	joy	moviereview
2405	10452_1	Strictly middle of the road .	disgust	moviereview
13597	10453_1	 Although purportedly a study in modern alienation  	disgust	moviereview
13620	10453_2	 , it 's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out .  	disgust	moviereview
13640	10454_1	 which is worth seeing  	disgust	moviereview
13662	10454_2	 After the first 10 minutes , 	disgust	moviereview
13683	10454_3	 , the movie sinks into an abyss of clichs , depression and bad alternative music .  	disgust	moviereview
24033	10455_1	  No one can doubt the filmmakers ' motives , 	joy	moviereview
24034	10455_2	  but The Guys still feels counterproductive . 	disgust	moviereview
4504	10456_1	A very slow , uneventful ride around a pretty tattered old carousel .	disgust	moviereview
21833	10457_1	  With little visible talent 	disgust	moviereview
21834	10457_2	  and no energy , Colin Hanks is in bad need of major acting lessons 	disgust	moviereview

4505	10459_1	A Meatballs for the bare-midriff generation .	noemotion	moviereview
3670	1045_1	The two leads chomp considerably more scenery with their acting than fire-breathing monsters barbecue with their breath ...	disgust	moviereview

13786	10460_2	 Well-meaning to a fault , Antwone Fisher manages 	joy	moviereview
21836	10461_1	  Seemingly disgusted with the lazy material 	disgust	moviereview
21837	10461_2	  and the finished product 's unshapely look , director Fisher Stevens inexplicably dips key moments from the film in Waking Life water colors . 	joy	moviereview
24035	10462_1	  Formula 51 promises a new kind of high 	disgust	moviereview

13807	10463_1	 Everything  that was right about Blade  	joy	moviereview
13851	10463_3	 is wrong in its sequel .  	disgust	moviereview
25110	10464_1	  A few energetic stunt sequences briefly enliven the film , 	joy	moviereview
25111	10464_2	  but the wheezing terrorist subplot has n't the stamina for the 100-minute running time , 	disgust	moviereview
25112	10464_3	  and the protagonists ' bohemian boorishness mars the spirit of good clean fun . 	disgust	moviereview
21838	10465_1	  The film was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer 	noemotion	moviereview
21839	10465_2	  and directed by Joel Schumacher , 	disgust	moviereview
21840	10465_3	  and reflects the worst of their shallow styles : wildly overproduced , inadequately motivated every step of the way 	disgust	moviereview
21841	10465_4	  and demographically targeted to please every one -LRB- 	disgust	moviereview
21842	10465_5	  and no one -RRB- . 	disgust	moviereview
2406	10466_1	Disney again ransacks its archives for a quick-buck sequel .	disgust	moviereview
13874	10467_1	 in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it  	disgust	moviereview
13896	10467_2	 Coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy 	disgust	moviereview
13917	10467_3	 squanders the charms of stars Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock .  	disgust	moviereview
13937	10468_1	 Anyone who suffers through this film  	disgust	moviereview
13980	10468_3	 deserves , at the very least , a big box of consolation candy .  	disgust	moviereview

14068	10470_1	 their audience wo n't sit still for a sociology lesson  	disgust	moviereview
14088	10470_2	 They presume 	disgust	moviereview
14110	10470_3	 , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes .  	disgust	moviereview
4506	10471_1	Collapses after 30 minutes into a slap-happy series of adolescent violence .	disgust	moviereview
14133	10472_1	 Seinfeld -LRB- who is also one of the film 's producers -RRB- do everything he can to look like a good guy  	disgust	moviereview
14156	10472_2	 The following things are not at all entertaining : The bad sound , the lack of climax and , worst of all , watching 	disgust	moviereview
14178	10473_1	 and , dare I say  	noemotion	moviereview
14199	10473_2	 that he could n't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident  	disgust	moviereview
14220	10473_3	 Attal 's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned 	disgust	moviereview
14242	10473_4	 , outdated , it 's a wonder 	disgust	moviereview
21843	10474_1	  Obvious , obnoxious 	disgust	moviereview
21844	10474_2	  and didactic burlesque . 	disgust	moviereview
14264	10475_1	 that they are actually releasing it into theaters  	disgust	moviereview
14284	10475_2	 The most surprising thing about this film is 	surprise	moviereview
14307	10476_1	 that it 's hard to take her spiritual quest at all seriously  	disgust	moviereview
14327	10476_2	 Michele is a such a brainless flibbertigibbet 	disgust	moviereview
21845	10477_1	  Ultimately , clarity matters , both in breaking codes 	disgust	moviereview
21846	10477_2	  and making movies . 	disgust	moviereview
2407	10478_1	Enigma lacks it .	disgust	moviereview
4507	10479_1	Potty-mouthed enough for PG-13 , yet not as hilariously raunchy as South Park , this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults .	disgust	moviereview
8297	1047_1	Biggie and Tupac is so single-mindedly daring , it puts far more polished documentaries to shame .	joy	moviereview
24037	10480_1	  ... has its moments , 	disgust	moviereview
24038	10480_2	  but ultimately , its curmudgeon does n't quite make the cut of being placed on any list of favorites . 	disgust	moviereview
14350	10481_1	 that will be seen to better advantage on cable , especially considering its barely  	disgust	moviereview
14372	10481_2	 A distinctly minor effort 	disgust	moviereview
14392	10481_3	 feature-length running time of one hour .  	noemotion	moviereview
14414	10482_1	 that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement  	disgust	moviereview
14437	10482_2	 Most of the movie is so deadly dull 	disgust	moviereview
14458	10483_1	 Everlasting falls victim to that everlasting conundrum experienced by every human who ever lived : too much to do , too little time to do it in  	disgust	moviereview
14481	10483_2	 In the end , Tuck 	disgust	moviereview
4508	10484_1	Rather less than the sum of its underventilated pre-fils confrontations .	disgust	moviereview
2408	10485_1	McKay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative .	disgust	moviereview
14502	10486_1	 that are still looking for a common through-line  	disgust	moviereview
14524	10486_2	 Plays like a series of vignettes -- clips of a film 	disgust	moviereview
4509	10487_1	New Yorkers always seem to find the oddest places to dwell ...	surprise	moviereview
21847	10488_1	  Amid the shock 	surprise	moviereview
21848	10488_2	  and curiosity factors , the film is just a corny examination of a young actress trying to find her way . 	disgust	moviereview
24039	10489_1	  Yes , Spirited Away is a triumph of imagination , 	joy	moviereview
24040	10489_2	  but it 's also a failure of storytelling . 	disgust	moviereview
23268	1048_1	  So many documentaries like this presuppose religious bigotry or zealous nuttiness of its antagonists , 	disgust	moviereview
23269	1048_2	  but Family Fundamentals displays a rare gift for unflinching impartiality . 	joy	moviereview
21849	10490_1	  A characteristically engorged 	disgust	moviereview
21850	10490_2	  and sloppy coming-of-age movie . 	disgust	moviereview
21851	10491_1	  A somewhat disappointing 	disgust	moviereview
21852	10491_2	  and meandering saga . 	disgust	moviereview
14544	10492_1	 which also appears to be the end  	disgust	moviereview
14564	10492_2	 Whenever you think you've seen the end of the movie  	disgust	moviereview
14606	10492_4	 , we cut to a new scene , 	disgust	moviereview
8463	10493_1	But , no , we get another scene , and then another .	disgust	moviereview
14627	10494_1	 as the desert does for rain  	disgust	moviereview
14650	10494_2	 You begin to long for the end credits 	disgust	moviereview
21853	10495_1	  An empty , ugly exercise in druggy trance-noir 	disgust	moviereview
21854	10495_2	  and trumped-up street credibility . 	disgust	moviereview
4510	10496_1	The screenplay , co-written by director Imogen Kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing .	disgust	moviereview
21855	10497_1	  The milieu is wholly unconvincing ... 	disgust	moviereview
21856	10497_2	  and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch . 	disgust	moviereview
21857	10498_1	  Unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , 	disgust	moviereview
21858	10498_2	  and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters . 	disgust	moviereview
14672	10499_1	 while the third feels limited by its short running time  	disgust	moviereview
14693	10499_2	 Each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , 	disgust	moviereview
148	1049_1	The cast is uniformly excellent and relaxed .	joy	moviereview
3574	104_1	But in Imax 3-D , the clich's disappear into the vertiginous perspectives opened up by the photography .	joy	moviereview
14715	10500_1	 who ultimately expresses empathy for Bartleby 's pain  	disgust	moviereview

14757	10500_3	 Except for Paymer as the boss 	noemotion	moviereview
14779	10500_4	 , the performances are so stylized 	disgust	moviereview
2409	10501_1	Will no doubt delight Plympton 's legion of fans ; others may find 80 minutes of these shenanigans exhausting .	disgust	moviereview
4511	10502_1	The laughs are as rare as snake foo yung .	disgust	moviereview
14800	10503_1	 that celebrates radical , nonconformist values , What to Do in Case of Fire  	joy	moviereview
14823	10503_2	 For a film 	joy	moviereview

14844	10505_1	 who desperately want to be Quentin Tarantino when they grow up  	disgust	moviereview
14864	10505_2	 Knockaround Guys plays like a student film by two guys 	disgust	moviereview
8464	10506_1	But they lack their idol 's energy and passion for detail .	disgust	moviereview
2410	10507_1	Mattei so completely loses himself to the film 's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , Love in the Time of Money .	disgust	moviereview
24041	10508_1	  It briefly flirts with player masochism , 	disgust	moviereview
24042	10508_2	  but the point of real interest - -- audience sadism -- is evaded completely . 	disgust	moviereview
14885	10509_1	 and far less crass -  	joy	moviereview
14905	10509_2	 Holland lets things peter out midway  	disgust	moviereview
14947	10509_4	 , but it 's notably better  acted 	joy	moviereview
14966	10509_5	 than some other recent efforts in the burgeoning genre of films about black urban professionals .  	joy	moviereview
2749	1050_1	After making several adaptations of other writers ' work , Armenian-Canadian director Atom Egoyan broached an original treatment of a deeply personal subject .	joy	moviereview

21860	10512_2	  and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle . 	disgust	moviereview

15088	10513_2	 It 's unfortunate 	disgust	moviereview
15108	10514_1	 I would have liked it more if it had just gone that one step further  	disgust	moviereview
15125	10514_2	 I liked the movie , but I know 	joy	moviereview

8465	10518_1	-LRB- Jackson and Bledel -RRB- seem to have been picked not for their acting chops , but for their looks and appeal to the pre-teen crowd .	disgust	moviereview

25775	1051_1	  The film is painfully authentic , 	sadness	moviereview

24043	10520_1	  Like Schindler 's List , The Grey Zone attempts to be grandiloquent , 	disgust	moviereview
24044	10520_2	  but ends up merely pretentious -- in a grisly sort of way . 	disgust	moviereview
15184	10521_1	 why the DV revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film  	disgust	moviereview
15205	10521_2	 An unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of 	disgust	moviereview
25113	10522_1	  -LRB- Screenwriter -RRB- Pimental took the Farrelly Brothers comedy 	noemotion	moviereview
25114	10522_2	  and feminized it , 	noemotion	moviereview
25115	10522_3	  but it is a rather poor imitation . 	disgust	moviereview
15226	10523_1	 that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey  	disgust	moviereview
15246	10523_2	 It 's kind of sad 	sadness	moviereview
2413	10524_1	Friday After Next is a lot more bluster than bite .	disgust	moviereview
15268	10525_1	 will have you forever on the verge of either cracking up or throwing up  	disgust	moviereview
15288	10525_2	 Its juxtaposition of overwrought existentialism and stomach-churning gore 	disgust	moviereview
4513	10526_1	A decidedly mixed bag .	disgust	moviereview
21863	10527_1	  There are cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , 	disgust	moviereview
21864	10527_2	  and many tired jokes about men in heels . 	disgust	moviereview
24045	10528_1	  Ice Cube is n't quite out of ripe screwball ideas , 	disgust	moviereview
24046	10528_2	  but Friday After Next spreads them pretty thin . 	disgust	moviereview

18186	10647_1	 but Jonah ... never shakes the oppressive , morally superior good-for-you quality that almost automatically accompanies didactic entertainment  	disgust	moviereview
18209	10647_2	 The animation is competent , and some of the gags are quite funny , 	joy	moviereview
21913	10648_1	  The pace of the film is very slow -LRB- for obvious reasons -RRB- 	disgust	moviereview
21914	10648_2	  and that too becomes off-putting . 	disgust	moviereview
25120	10649_1	  Mr. Wollter 	noemotion	moviereview

2430	10655_1	Despite some comic sparks , Welcome to Collinwood never catches fire .	disgust	moviereview
25124	10656_1	  Director George Hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries , 	joy	moviereview

25126	10656_3	  and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad , 	disgust	moviereview
25127	10656_4	  and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place . 	disgust	moviereview
25128	10657_1	  Shows moments of promise 	disgust	moviereview

2431	10658_1	Even accepting this in the right frame of mind can only provide it with so much leniency .	disgust	moviereview

25131	10668_1	  I liked the original short story 	disgust	moviereview
25132	10668_2	  but this movie , even at an hour 	noemotion	moviereview
25133	10668_3	  and twenty-some minutes , it 's too long 	disgust	moviereview
25134	10668_4	  and it goes nowhere . 	disgust	moviereview

24055	10672_1	  Aspires to the cracked lunacy of The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai , 	joy	moviereview
24056	10672_2	  but thanks to an astonishingly witless script ends up more like The Adventures of Ford Fairlane . 	disgust	moviereview
21917	10673_1	  Real-life strongman Ahola lacks the charisma 	disgust	moviereview
21918	10673_2	  and ability to carry the film on his admittedly broad shoulders . 	disgust	moviereview
4537	10674_1	The title , alone , should scare any sane person away .	disgust	moviereview
2433	10675_1	Low comedy does n't come much lower .	disgust	moviereview
4538	10676_1	Appropriately cynical social commentary aside , # 9 never quite ignites .	disgust	moviereview
2434	10677_1	It 's crap on a leash -- far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of Joe Dante 's similarly styled Gremlins .	disgust	moviereview
13166	10678_1	 I can think of  	noemotion	moviereview
13189	10678_2	 One of the most depressing movie-going experiences 	disgust	moviereview
13212	10678_3	 is to sit through about 90 minutes of a so-called ` comedy ' and not laugh once .  	disgust	moviereview
13231	10679_1	 where the big scene is a man shot out of a cannon into a vat of ice cream  	noemotion	moviereview
13254	10679_2	 This is the kind of movie 	disgust	moviereview
25781	1067_1	  Highlights are the terrific performances by Christopher Plummer , as the prime villain , 	joy	moviereview

21921	10682_1	  An exceptionally dreary 	disgust	moviereview
21922	10682_2	  and overwrought bit of work , every bit as imperious as Katzenberg 's The Prince of Egypt from 1998 . 	disgust	moviereview
13319	10683_1	 that it even uses a totally unnecessary prologue , just because it seems obligatory  	disgust	moviereview
13339	10683_2	 The movie is so resolutely cobbled together out of older movies 	disgust	moviereview
13362	10684_1	 only a true believer could relish  	disgust	moviereview
13385	10684_2	 The movie 's vision of a white American zealously spreading a Puritanical brand of Christianity to South Seas islanders is one 	disgust	moviereview
13407	10685_1	 that it 's easier to change the sheets than to change hackneyed concepts when it comes to dreaming up romantic comedies  	disgust	moviereview
13428	10685_2	 Maid in Manhattan proves 	noemotion	moviereview
24057	10686_1	  A fairly harmless 	disgust	moviereview
24058	10686_2	  but ultimately lifeless feature-length afterschool special . 	disgust	moviereview
13449	10687_1	 I saw a movie where I wanted so badly for the protagonist to fail  	disgust	moviereview

21925	10696_1	  Cruel 	disgust	moviereview
21926	10696_2	  and inhuman cinematic punishment ... simultaneously degrades its characters , its stars 	disgust	moviereview
21927	10696_3	  and its audience . 	disgust	moviereview
21928	10697_1	  It 's not too fast 	joy	moviereview

21930	10698_1	  It 's not too racy 	disgust	moviereview

21932	10703_1	  We could have expected a little more human being , 	anticipation	moviereview
21933	10703_2	  and a little less product . 	noemotion	moviereview

13897	10714_1	 it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film  	disgust	moviereview
13918	10714_2	 The story of Trouble Every Day ... is so sketchy 	disgust	moviereview

2441	10715_1	A Movie to Forget	disgust	moviereview
21940	10716_1	  For all of its insights into the dream world of teen life , 	disgust	moviereview
21941	10716_2	  and its electronic expression through cyber culture , the film gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2 1/2 - hour running time . 	disgust	moviereview
4542	10717_1	Enough is not a bad movie , just mediocre .	disgust	moviereview
2442	10718_1	The performances are so overstated , the effect comes off as self-parody .	disgust	moviereview

17120	10859_1	 even fans of Sandler 's comic taste may find it uninteresting  	disgust	moviereview
17142	10859_2	 It 's definitely not made for kids or their parents , for that matter , and I think 	disgust	moviereview
3675	1085_1	It took 19 predecessors to get THIS ?	disgust	moviereview
21994	10860_1	  Sheridan seems terrified of the book 's irreverent energy , 	disgust	moviereview
21995	10860_2	  and scotches most of its lan , humor , bile , and irony .	disgust	moviereview
2464	10861_1	More busy than exciting , more frantic than involving , more chaotic than entertaining .	disgust	moviereview
17164	10862_1	 which hurts the overall impact of the film  	disgust	moviereview
17187	10862_2	 There are more shots of children smiling for the camera than typical documentary footage 	disgust	moviereview
2465	10863_1	It 's makes a better travelogue than movie .	disgust	moviereview
17210	10864_1	 It's as if Solondz had two ideas for two movies , could n't really figure out how to flesh either out , so he just slopped ` em together here  	disgust	moviereview
17253	10865_1	 that I 'll bet most parents had thought -- hoped 	anticipation	moviereview

17358	10867_1	 what once was conviction  	disgust	moviereview
17381	10867_2	 It 's a long way from Orwell 's dark , intelligent warning cry -LRB- 1984 -RRB- to the empty stud knockabout of Equilibrium , and 	disgust	moviereview
17402	10867_3	 is now affectation .  	joy	moviereview
24069	10868_1	  Its premise is smart , 	joy	moviereview
24070	10868_2	  but the execution is pretty weary . 	disgust	moviereview
2466	10869_1	The holiday message of the 37-minute Santa vs. the Snowman leaves a lot to be desired .	disgust	moviereview
25794	1086_1	  Thoughtful , even stinging at times , 	joy	moviereview
25795	1086_2	  and lots of fun . 	joy	moviereview

17509	10872_2	 -LRB- T -RRB- he script is n't up to the level of the direction , nor are the uneven performances by the cast members , 	disgust	moviereview

17610	10875_1	 Yet why it fails  	disgust	moviereview
17632	10875_2	 is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma .  	surprise	moviereview
4558	10876_1	Most of the characters come off as pantomimesque sterotypes .	disgust	moviereview
24071	10877_1	  Starts promisingly 	joy	moviereview
24072	10877_2	  but disintegrates into a dreary , humorless soap opera . 	disgust	moviereview
17652	10878_1	 While there 's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the Elizabethans -LRB- as well as rank frustration from those in the know about Rubbo 's dumbed-down tactics -RRB-  	disgust	moviereview
17675	10878_2	 , Much Ado About Something is an amicable endeavor .  	joy	moviereview
4559	10879_1	It 's actually too sincere -- the crime movie equivalent of a chick flick .	disgust	moviereview
3676	1087_1	One of the most haunting , viciously honest coming-of-age films in recent memory .	joy	moviereview
21996	10880_1	  Most of the film feels conceived 	joy	moviereview
21997	10880_2	  and shot on the fly -- like between lunch breaks for Shearer 's radio show 	disgust	moviereview
21998	10880_3	  and his Simpson voice-overs . 	disgust	moviereview
25144	10881_1	  Perry 's good 	disgust	moviereview
25145	10881_2	  and his is an interesting character , 	disgust	moviereview
25146	10881_3	  but `` Serving Sara '' has n't much more to serve than silly fluff . 	disgust	moviereview
4560	10882_1	Nor is it a romantic comedy .	noemotion	moviereview
17697	10883_1	 what is basically an anti-Harry Potter -- right down to the Gryffindor scarf  	disgust	moviereview
17720	10883_2	 Culkin turns his character into 	noemotion	moviereview
17740	10884_1	 that renders its tension flaccid  	disgust	moviereview
17762	10884_2	 Memorable for a peculiar malaise 	disgust	moviereview
17782	10884_3	 and , by extension , its surprises limp and its resolutions ritual .  	disgust	moviereview
17804	10885_1	 that says that the alternate sexuality meant to set you free may require so much relationship maintenance that celibacy can start looking good  	disgust	moviereview
17824	10885_2	 It 's a documentary 	noemotion	moviereview
2467	10886_1	In the not-too-distant future , movies like Ghost Ship will be used as analgesic balm for overstimulated minds .	disgust	moviereview
2468	10887_1	Right now , they 're merely signposts marking the slow , lingering death of imagination .	disgust	moviereview
17845	10888_1	 no respectable Halloween costume shop would ever try to sell  	disgust	moviereview
17865	10888_2	 The movie 's biggest shocks come from seeing former nymphette Juliette Lewis playing a salt-of-the-earth mommy named Minnie and watching Slim travel incognito in a ridiculous wig 	disgust	moviereview
4561	10889_1	Like most movies about the pitfalls of bad behavior ... Circuit gets drawn into the party .	disgust	moviereview
7796	1088_1	 who are never what they first appear  	joy	moviereview
7797	1088_2	 The WWII drama is well plotted , visually striking and filled with enjoyably complex characters 	joy	moviereview
17887	10890_1	 as if even the filmmakers did n't know what kind of movie they were making  	disgust	moviereview
17909	10890_2	 It appears 	noemotion	moviereview
21999	10891_1	  Beneath the uncanny , inevitable 	noemotion	moviereview
22000	10891_2	  and seemingly shrewd facade of movie-biz farce ... lies a plot cobbled together from largely flat 	disgust	moviereview
22001	10891_3	  and uncreative moments . 	disgust	moviereview
2469	10892_1	Snipes relies too much on a scorchingly plotted dramatic scenario for its own good .	disgust	moviereview
25147	10893_1	  Piccoli 's performance is amazing , yes , 	joy	moviereview
25148	10893_2	  but the symbols of loss 	noemotion	moviereview
25149	10893_3	  and denial 	disgust	moviereview
25150	10893_4	  and life-at-arm 's - length in the film seem irritatingly transparent . 	disgust	moviereview
22002	10894_1	  Starts out mediocre , spirals downward , 	disgust	moviereview
22003	10894_2	  and thuds to the bottom of the pool with an utterly incompetent conclusion . 	disgust	moviereview
17930	10895_1	 what is already an erratic career  	disgust	moviereview
17951	10895_2	 Nicolas Cage is n't the first actor to lead a group of talented friends astray , and this movie wo n't create a ruffle in 	disgust	moviereview
17991	10896_2	 It lacks the compassion , good-natured humor and the level of insight 	disgust	moviereview
18013	10896_3	 that made  -LRB- Eyre 's -RRB- first film something of a sleeper success .  	disgust	moviereview
4562	10897_1	The result is good gossip , entertainingly delivered , yet with a distinctly musty odour , its expiry date long gone .	disgust	moviereview
18034	10898_1	 that leaves scant place for the viewer  	disgust	moviereview
18056	10898_2	 A sustained fest of self-congratulation between actor and director 	disgust	moviereview
18078	10899_1	 That proves  	joy	moviereview
18101	10899_2	 that there is really only one movie 's worth of decent gags to be gleaned from the premise  	disgust	moviereview
18123	10899_3	 All Analyze 	disgust	moviereview

18164	10900_1	 while it 's not completely wreaked  	disgust	moviereview
18187	10900_2	 Green ruins every single scene he 's in , and the film , 	disgust	moviereview
18210	10900_3	 , is seriously compromised by that .  	disgust	moviereview
2470	10901_1	There 's not a comedic moment in this romantic comedy .	disgust	moviereview
22004	10902_1	  The story is predictable , the jokes are typical Sandler fare , 	disgust	moviereview
22005	10902_2	  and the romance with Ryder is puzzling . 	disgust	moviereview
2471	10903_1	Wallace directs with such patronising reverence , it turns the stomach .	disgust	moviereview
2472	10904_1	Resurrection has the dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad Blair Witch Project .	disgust	moviereview

18271	10906_1	 Pretend like your SAT scores are below 120 and you might not notice the flaws  	disgust	moviereview
18316	10907_1	 that the idea of exploiting molestation for laughs is funny , not actually exploiting it yourself  	disgust	moviereview
18336	10907_2	 Unlike Trey Parker , Sandler does n't understand 	disgust	moviereview
18358	10908_1	 that keeps telling you  	disgust	moviereview

22007	10911_2	  and psychologically unpersuasive , with an inconclusive ending . 	disgust	moviereview
18464	10912_1	 that is undercut by its awkward structure and a final veering toward melodrama  	disgust	moviereview

22008	10914_1	  A distinctly mixed bag , the occasional bursts of sharp writing alternating with lots of sloppiness 	disgust	moviereview
22009	10914_2	  and the obligatory moments of sentimental ooze . 	joy	moviereview
18504	10915_1	 What begins brightly  	disgust	moviereview

2476	10919_1	Feels like nothing quite so much as a middle-aged moviemaker 's attempt to surround himself with beautiful , half-naked women .	disgust	moviereview
25796	1091_1	  This time out , -LRB- Sade -RRB- is an unsettlingly familiar figure -- in turns loyal 	disgust	moviereview

13213	10920_2	 , the revelation fails to justify the build-up .  	disgust	moviereview
22010	10921_1	  This picture is murder by numbers , 	disgust	moviereview

974	10922_1	Hilarious musical comedy though stymied by accents thick as mud .	joy	moviereview

24073	10931_1	  A handsome 	disgust	moviereview
24074	10931_2	  but unfulfilling suspense drama more suited to a quiet evening on PBS than a night out at an AMC . 	disgust	moviereview

22016	10934_2	  and feels like three hours . 	disgust	moviereview
25151	10935_1	  A reworking of Die Hard 	disgust	moviereview
25152	10935_2	  and Cliffhanger 	disgust	moviereview
25153	10935_3	  but it 's nowhere near as exciting as either . 	disgust	moviereview
22017	10936_1	  Suffers from unlikable characters 	disgust	moviereview
22018	10936_2	  and a self-conscious sense of its own quirky hipness . 	disgust	moviereview

13622	10941_2	 It stars schticky Chris Rock and stolid Anthony Hopkins , 	disgust	moviereview
2479	10942_1	Their contrast is neither dramatic nor comic -- it 's just a weird fizzle .	disgust	moviereview
976	10943_1	This is a children 's film in the truest sense .	joy	moviereview

22021	10945_1	  Parents , on the other hand , will be ahead of the plot at all times , 	disgust	moviereview
22022	10945_2	  and there is n't enough clever innuendo to fil 	disgust	moviereview
22023	10946_1	  The niftiest trick perpetrated by The Importance of Being Earnest is the alchemical transmogrification of Wilde into Austen -- 	joy	moviereview

13642	10947_1	 Kieslowski 's work aspired to , including the condition of art  	joy	moviereview
13664	10947_2	 Tykwer 's surface flash is n't just a poor fit with Kieslowski 's lyrical pessimism ; it completely contradicts everything 	disgust	moviereview

13706	10948_2	 and that makes for some glacial pacing early on  	joy	moviereview

22025	10949_1	  Too slick 	disgust	moviereview
22026	10949_2	  and manufactured to claim street credibility . 	disgust	moviereview
3678	1094_1	It 's like a poem .	joy	moviereview
22027	10950_1	  Cherry Orchard is badly edited , often awkwardly directed 	disgust	moviereview
22028	10950_2	  and suffers from the addition of a wholly unnecessary pre-credit sequence designed to give some of the characters a ` back story . ' 	disgust	moviereview
13766	10951_1	 What ensues are much blood-splattering , mass drug-induced bowel evacuations , and none-too-funny commentary on the cultural distinctions between Americans and Brits  	disgust	moviereview
13809	10952_1	 that goes for sick and demented humor simply to do so  	disgust	moviereview
13830	10952_2	 A dark comedy 	disgust	moviereview
2480	10953_1	The movie is without intent .	disgust	moviereview

25155	10957_2	  and Hugh Grant make a great team , 	joy	moviereview
25156	10957_3	  but this predictable romantic comedy should get a pink slip . 	disgust	moviereview

14003	10958_2	 Allegiance to Chekhov , 	noemotion	moviereview
14026	10958_3	 , is a particularly vexing handicap .  	disgust	moviereview

22030	10959_2	  and screenwriter Nicholas Kazan -LRB- Reversal of Fortune -RRB- than this cliche pileup . 	disgust	moviereview

25801	1095_2	  and unselfconscious , 	joy	moviereview
25802	1095_3	  and Munch is a marvel of reality versus sappy sentiment . 	joy	moviereview
22031	10960_1	  The first mistake , I suspect , is casting Shatner as a legendary professor 	disgust	moviereview
22032	10960_2	  and Kunis as a brilliant college student -- where 's Pauly Shore as the rocket scientist ? 	disgust	moviereview
22033	10961_1	  The dramatic scenes are frequently unintentionally funny , 	disgust	moviereview

2506	11147_1	To call this film a lump of coal would only be to flatter it .	disgust	moviereview
4594	11148_1	Entertainment more disposable than Hanna-Barbera 's half-hour cartoons ever were .	disgust	moviereview
17568	11149_1	 that have made the original New Testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries  	disgust	moviereview
17590	11149_2	 The film falls short on tension , eloquence , spiritual challenge -- things 	disgust	moviereview
25813	1114_1	  Once again , director Jackson strikes a rewarding balance between emotion on the human scale 	joy	moviereview

2992	11152_1	It 's not an easy one to review .	noemotion	moviereview
4595	11153_1	At best this is a film for the under-7 crowd .	disgust	moviereview

22106	11192_1	  The movie is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise 	disgust	moviereview
22107	11192_2	  and consistent emotional conviction . 	disgust	moviereview
13191	11193_1	 that you 'd swear you  	disgust	moviereview
13214	11193_2	 Festers in just such a dungpile 	disgust	moviereview
13233	11193_3	 were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you .  	disgust	moviereview
13256	11194_1	 just how far his storytelling skills have eroded  	disgust	moviereview
13278	11194_2	 Lyne 's latest , the erotic thriller Unfaithful , further demonstrates 	disgust	moviereview
13299	11195_1	 how it plays out  	disgust	moviereview
13321	11195_2	 It sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss , and that 's more or less 	disgust	moviereview
2512	11196_1	Rumor , a muddled drama about coming to terms with death , feels impersonal , almost generic .	disgust	moviereview
2513	11197_1	Report card : Does n't live up to the exalted tagline - there 's definite room for improvement .	disgust	moviereview
2514	11198_1	Does n't deserve a passing grade -LRB- even on a curve -RRB- .	disgust	moviereview
22108	11199_1	  The pacing is deadly , the narration helps little 	disgust	moviereview
22109	11199_2	  and Naipaul , a juicy writer , is negated . 	disgust	moviereview
7819	1119_1	 is probably  	disgust	moviereview
7820	1119_2	 No one goes unindicted here , which 	disgust	moviereview
24310	111_1	  On the surface , it 's a lovers-on-the-run crime flick , 	noemotion	moviereview
24311	111_2	  but it has a lot in common with Piesiewicz 's 	noemotion	moviereview
24312	111_3	  and Kieslowski 's earlier work , films like The Double Life of Veronique . 	noemotion	moviereview
13341	11200_1	 As his circle of friends keeps getting smaller  	noemotion	moviereview
13364	11200_2	 one of the characters in Long Time Dead says ` I 'm telling you , this is f *** ed ' .  	noemotion	moviereview
2995	11201_1	Maybe he was reading the minds of the audience .	noemotion	moviereview
13387	11202_1	 if it had been only half-an-hour long or a TV special  	noemotion	moviereview
13430	11202_3	 , the humor would have been fast and furious -- at ninety minutes , it drags .  	disgust	moviereview
2515	11203_1	Bean drops the ball too many times ... hoping the nifty premise will create enough interest to make up for an unfocused screenplay .	disgust	moviereview
24093	11204_1	  A well-acted , 	joy	moviereview
24094	11204_2	  but one-note film . 	disgust	moviereview
13451	11205_1	 with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from Eastwood 's Dirty Harry period  	disgust	moviereview
13471	11205_2	 Blood Work is laughable in the solemnity 	disgust	moviereview
2516	11206_1	The movie is too amateurishly square to make the most of its own ironic implications .	disgust	moviereview
13494	11207_1	 the same way that Jim Brown treats his women -- as dumb , credulous , unassuming , subordinate subjects  	disgust	moviereview
13515	11207_2	 -LRB- Lee -RRB- treats his audience 	disgust	moviereview
4599	11208_1	And Lee seems just as expectant of an adoring , wide-smiling reception .	joy	moviereview
22110	11209_1	  There 's not one decent performance from the cast 	disgust	moviereview
22111	11209_2	  and not one clever line of dialogue . 	disgust	moviereview
7821	1120_1	 And if you 're not nearly moved to tears by a couple of scenes  	sadness	moviereview
7822	1120_2	 you 've got ice water in your veins . 	joy	moviereview
22112	11210_1	  No amount of burning , blasting , stabbing , 	disgust	moviereview
22113	11210_2	  and shooting can hide a weak script . 	disgust	moviereview
2517	11211_1	It 's an odd show , pregnant with moods , stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise .	disgust	moviereview
13536	11212_1	 for granted in most films are mishandled here  	disgust	moviereview
13557	11212_2	 Nearly all the fundamentals you take 	disgust	moviereview
22114	11213_1	  The Armenian genocide deserves a more engaged 	disgust	moviereview
22115	11213_2	  and honest treatment . 	disgust	moviereview
22116	11214_1	  Earnest yet curiously tepid 	disgust	moviereview
22117	11214_2	  and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner . 	disgust	moviereview
22118	11215_1	  Ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of Louis Begley 's source novel -LRB- About Schmidt -RRB- 	disgust	moviereview
22119	11215_2	  and an old Payne screenplay . 	disgust	moviereview
2518	11216_1	The exploitative , clumsily staged violence overshadows everything , including most of the actors .	disgust	moviereview
22120	11217_1	  We started to wonder if ... some unpaid intern had just typed ` Chris Rock , ' ` Anthony Hopkins ' 	disgust	moviereview
22121	11217_2	  and ` terrorists ' into some Univac-like script machine . 	disgust	moviereview
13579	11218_1	 Even when Crush departs from the 4W formula  	disgust	moviereview
13600	11218_2	 ... it feels like a glossy rehash .  	disgust	moviereview
2519	11219_1	More likely to have you scratching your head than hiding under your seat .	disgust	moviereview
157	1121_1	A warm , funny , engaging film .	joy	moviereview
13623	11220_1	 than I imagined a movie ever could be  	disgust	moviereview
13643	11220_2	 Bears is even worse 	disgust	moviereview
13665	11221_1	 When you find yourself rooting for the monsters in a horror movie  	disgust	moviereview
13707	11221_3	 , you know 	disgust	moviereview
2520	11222_1	This is very much of a mixed bag , with enough negatives to outweigh the positives .	disgust	moviereview
22122	11223_1	  Marinated in clichs 	disgust	moviereview
22123	11223_2	  and mawkish dialogue . 	disgust	moviereview
13726	11224_1	 Whether it 's the worst movie of 2002  	disgust	moviereview
13745	11224_2	 , I ca n't say for sure : Memories of Rollerball have faded , and I skipped Country Bears .  	disgust	moviereview
8470	11225_1	But this new jangle of noise , mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title .	disgust	moviereview
13767	11226_1	 that strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain  	disgust	moviereview
13788	11226_2	 -LRB- A -RRB- boldly stroked , luridly coloured , uni-dimensional nonsense machine 	disgust	moviereview
13810	11227_1	 I become very involved in the proceedings  	disgust	moviereview
13831	11227_2	 Not once in the rush to save the day did 	noemotion	moviereview
13854	11227_3	 ; to me , it was just a matter of ` eh . '  	disgust	moviereview
13877	11228_1	 and worse  than you can imagine  	disgust	moviereview
13899	11228_2	 Rollerball IS as bad as you think  	disgust	moviereview
13961	11229_1	 why Anthony Hopkins is in it  	disgust	moviereview
13983	11229_2	 The first question to ask about Bad Company is 	disgust	moviereview
25815	1122_1	  Uses sharp humor 	joy	moviereview
25816	1122_2	  and insight into human nature to examine class conflict , adolescent yearning , the roots of friendship 	joy	moviereview
25817	1122_3	  and sexual identity . 	noemotion	moviereview
14004	11230_1	 he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce , because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low  	disgust	moviereview
14027	11230_2	 We assume 	disgust	moviereview
2521	11231_1	Not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general .	disgust	moviereview
2522	11232_1	It merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them .	disgust	moviereview
22124	11233_1	  Shame on writer/director Vicente Aranda for making a florid biopic about mad queens , obsessive relationships , 	disgust	moviereview
22125	11233_2	  and rampant adultery so dull . 	disgust	moviereview
2523	11234_1	Suffers from a decided lack of creative storytelling .	disgust	moviereview
22126	11235_1	  Violent , vulgar 	disgust	moviereview
22127	11235_2	  and forgettably entertaining . 	joy	moviereview
22128	11236_1	  Nothing happens , 	noemotion	moviereview
22129	11236_2	  and it happens to flat characters . 	disgust	moviereview
14049	11237_1	 that you 've seen it all before , even if you 've never come within a mile of The Longest Yard  	disgust	moviereview
14070	11237_2	 With a completely predictable plot , you 'll swear 	disgust	moviereview
14091	11238_1	 when thrillers actually thrilled  	disgust	moviereview
14113	11238_2	 Remember back 	disgust	moviereview
4600	11239_1	When the twist endings were actually surprising ?	surprise	moviereview
1547	1123_1	Half Submarine flick , Half Ghost Story , All in one criminally neglected film	disgust	moviereview
2996	11240_1	When the violence actually shocked ?	noemotion	moviereview
4601	11241_1	When the heroes were actually under 40 ?	noemotion	moviereview
14136	11242_1	 Sadly , as Blood Work proves  	sadness	moviereview
14181	11242_3	 , that was a long , long time ago .  	sadness	moviereview
14200	11243_1	 that gives pic its title an afterthought  	joy	moviereview
14223	11243_2	 Blue Crush has all the trappings of an energetic , extreme-sports adventure , but ends up more of a creaky `` Pretty Woman '' retread , with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing 	disgust	moviereview
2524	11244_1	This movie plays like an extended dialogue exercise in Retard 101 .	disgust	moviereview
14245	11245_1	 What we get in FearDotCom  	disgust	moviereview
14267	11245_2	 is more like something from a bad Clive Barker movie .  	disgust	moviereview
2525	11246_1	In other words , it 's badder than bad .	disgust	moviereview
14287	11247_1	 it might have held my attention  	disgust	moviereview
14330	11247_3	 If they broke out into elaborate choreography  	noemotion	moviereview
14353	11247_4	 , singing and finger snapping 	disgust	moviereview
14395	11247_6	  but as it stands I kept looking for the last exit from Brooklyn .  	disgust	moviereview
22130	11248_1	  A sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare like The Ghost 	disgust	moviereview
22131	11248_2	  and Mr. Chicken . 	disgust	moviereview
4602	11249_1	A small independent film suffering from a severe case of Hollywood-itis .	disgust	moviereview
158	1124_1	Entertains by providing good , lively company .	joy	moviereview
14417	11250_1	 Where the film falters is in its tone 	disgust	moviereview
2526	11251_1	The story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head .	disgust	moviereview
14461	11252_1	 that one woman 's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness  	disgust	moviereview
14484	11252_2	 Ultimately , Sarah 's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic , and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case 	disgust	moviereview
14505	11253_1	 how hope can breed a certain kind of madness -- and strength  	disgust	moviereview
14527	11253_2	 It 's supposed to be a humorous , all-too-human look at 	joy	moviereview
14547	11253_3	 -- but it never quite adds up .  	disgust	moviereview
2527	11254_1	Feels more like a rejected X-Files episode than a credible account of a puzzling real-life happening .	disgust	moviereview
14567	11255_1	 ultimate thrills  	joy	moviereview
14587	11255_2	 Some motion pictures portray ultimate passion ; others create 	joy	moviereview
2528	11256_1	Men in Black II achieves ultimate insignificance -- it 's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as Whiffle-Ball epic .	disgust	moviereview
14609	11257_1	 that 's too clever for its own good  	disgust	moviereview
14630	11257_2	 An enigmatic film 	joy	moviereview
14653	11257_3	 , it 's a conundrum not worth solving .  	disgust	moviereview
2529	11258_1	A zombie movie in every sense of the word -- mindless , lifeless , meandering , loud , painful , obnoxious .	disgust	moviereview
14675	11259_1	 that clearly means to preach exclusively to the converted 	disgust	moviereview
14696	11259_2	 A film 	disgust	moviereview
7823	1125_1	 Dazzles with its fully-written characters , its determined stylishness -LRB- 	joy	moviereview
7824	1125_2	 always relates to characters and story -RRB- and Johnny Dankworth 's best soundtrack in years . 	joy	moviereview
14740	11260_1	 that this is a Mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that  	disgust	moviereview
14760	11260_2	 It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out 	disgust	moviereview
24095	11261_1	  Definitely a crowd-pleaser , 	joy	moviereview
24096	11261_2	  but then , so was the Roman Colosseum . 	joy	moviereview
24097	11262_1	  Certainly not a good movie , 	disgust	moviereview
24098	11262_2	  but it was n't horrible either . 	disgust	moviereview
14782	11263_1	 Although it starts off so bad that you feel like running out screaming  	disgust	moviereview
14803	11263_2	 , it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful .  	disgust	moviereview
14825	11264_1	 that even slightly wised-up kids would quickly change the channel  	disgust	moviereview
14845	11264_2	 The result is so tame 	disgust	moviereview
14867	11265_1	 the filmmakers could dredge up  	disgust	moviereview
14887	11265_2	 It appears to have been modeled on the worst revenge-of-the-nerds clichs 	disgust	moviereview
24099	11266_1	  Nothing 	noemotion	moviereview
24100	11266_2	  but an episode of Smackdown ! 	disgust	moviereview
22132	11267_1	  in period costume 	joy	moviereview
22133	11267_2	  and with a bigger budget . 	noemotion	moviereview
14908	11268_1	 it 's surprisingly old-fashioned  	surprise	moviereview
14929	11268_2	 It takes you somewhere you 're not likely to have seen before , but beneath the exotic surface -LRB- and exotic dancing -RRB- 	joy	moviereview
14950	11269_1	 While the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible Anne Rice novel it 's based upon  	joy	moviereview
14968	11269_2	 , Queen Of The Damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle .  	disgust	moviereview
25818	1126_1	  Visually imaginative , thematically instructive 	joy	moviereview
25819	1126_2	  and thoroughly delightful , it takes us on a roller-coaster ride from innocence to experience without even a hint of that typical kiddie-flick sentimentality . 	joy	moviereview
2530	11270_1	It should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring .	disgust	moviereview
25179	11271_1	  A good-looking 	joy	moviereview
25180	11271_2	  but ultimately pointless political thriller with plenty of action 	disgust	moviereview
25181	11271_3	  and almost no substance . 	disgust	moviereview
2531	11272_1	A tired , predictable , bordering on offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid .	disgust	moviereview
14989	11273_1	 it 's because there 's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair  	disgust	moviereview
15010	11273_2	 If Hill is n't quite his generation 's Don Siegel -LRB- or Robert Aldrich -RRB-  	disgust	moviereview
15050	11273_4	 ; it 's all bluster and clich .  	disgust	moviereview
15071	11274_1	 as it is repetitious  	disgust	moviereview
15091	11274_2	 Stealing Harvard will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : A few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin 	disgust	moviereview
22134	11275_1	  This is an insultingly inept 	disgust	moviereview
22135	11275_2	  and artificial examination of grief 	disgust	moviereview
22136	11275_3	  and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors . 	disgust	moviereview
15111	11276_1	 Does anyone much think the central story of Brendan Behan is 	noemotion	moviereview
15128	11276_2	 that he was a bisexual sweetheart before he took to drink  	joy	moviereview
15187	11277_1	 ` Martin Lawrence Live ' is so self-pitying  	disgust	moviereview
15228	11277_3	 , I almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show .  	disgust	moviereview
22137	11278_1	  The dialogue is cumbersome , the simpering soundtrack 	disgust	moviereview
22138	11278_2	  and editing more so . 	disgust	moviereview
15249	11279_1	 whether it wants to be a black comedy , drama , melodrama or some combination of the three  	disgust	moviereview
15271	11279_2	 Never decides 	disgust	moviereview
159	1127_1	Nothing 's at stake , just a twisty double-cross you can smell a mile away -- still , the derivative Nine Queens is lots of fun .	joy	moviereview
15291	11280_1	 that the franchise 's best years are long past  	disgust	moviereview
15313	11280_2	 It has become apparent 	disgust	moviereview
15333	11281_1	 Does what should seem impossible  	surprise	moviereview
15374	11281_3	 : it makes serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer boring .  	disgust	moviereview

15416	11282_2	 Do n't hate El Crimen del Padre Amaro 	disgust	moviereview
15437	11283_1	 Hate it because it 's lousy  	anger	moviereview

15479	11285_1	 they 're struggling to create  	disgust	moviereview
15501	11285_2	 Like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art 	disgust	moviereview
15521	11286_1	 they do n't understand  	disgust	moviereview
15541	11286_2	 ones they figure the power-lunchers do n't care to understand , either  	disgust	moviereview
15563	11286_3	 The filmmakers are playing to the Big Boys in New York and L.A. To that end , they mock the kind of folks 	disgust	moviereview
24101	11287_1	  Competently directed 	joy	moviereview
24102	11287_2	  but terminally cute drama . 	joy	moviereview
22139	11288_1	  The big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair 	disgust	moviereview
22140	11288_2	  and then biting into it 	disgust	moviereview
22141	11288_3	  and finding the filling missing . 	disgust	moviereview
4604	11289_1	Not just unlikable .	disgust	moviereview
25820	1128_1	  Unlike the speedy wham-bam effect of most Hollywood offerings , character development -- 	disgust	moviereview
25821	1128_2	  and more importantly , character empathy -- is at the heart of Italian for Beginners . 	joy	moviereview
4605	11290_1	Disturbing .	fear	moviereview

2535	11299_1	In terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused .	disgust	moviereview
25822	1129_1	  You 'll gasp appalled 	disgust	moviereview

18189	11417_2	 One key problem with these ardently Christian storylines is 	disgust	moviereview
22190	11418_1	  Essentially , the film is weak on detail 	joy	moviereview
22191	11418_2	  and strong on personality 	joy	moviereview
22192	11419_1	  A relentless , bombastic 	disgust	moviereview
22193	11419_2	  and ultimately empty World War II action flick . 	disgust	moviereview
7839	1141_1	 It moves quickly , adroitly , and without fuss ;	joy	moviereview

22196	11422_1	  Leaves viewers out in the cold 	disgust	moviereview
22197	11422_2	  and undermines some phenomenal performances . 	disgust	moviereview
2559	11423_1	... a ho-hum affair , always watchable yet hardly memorable .	disgust	moviereview
22198	11424_1	  Swiftly deteriorates into a terribly obvious melodrama 	disgust	moviereview
22199	11424_2	  and rough-hewn vanity project for lead actress Andie MacDowell . 	disgust	moviereview
22200	11425_1	  The histrionic muse still eludes Madonna 	disgust	moviereview
22201	11425_2	  and , playing a charmless witch , she is merely a charmless witch . 	disgust	moviereview

8298	1142_1	A deep and meaningful film .	joy	moviereview
24115	11430_1	  A technically well-made suspenser ... 	joy	moviereview
24116	11430_2	  but its abrupt drop in IQ points as it races to the finish line proves simply too discouraging to let slide . 	disgust	moviereview
2561	11431_1	An inept , tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more .	disgust	moviereview
18360	11432_1	 how the movie could be released in this condition  	disgust	moviereview
18381	11432_2	 It 's a mystery 	disgust	moviereview

22204	11438_1	  ` Dragonfly ' dwells on crossing-over mumbo jumbo , manipulative sentimentality , 	disgust	moviereview
22205	11438_2	  and sappy dialogue . 	disgust	moviereview
8472	11439_1	In his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter , Silberling also , to a certain extent , trivializes the movie with too many nervous gags and pratfalls .	disgust	moviereview
25829	1143_1	  The film 's welcome breeziness 	joy	moviereview
25830	1143_2	  and some unbelievably hilarious moments -- most portraying the idiocy of the film industry -- make it mostly worth the trip . 	joy	moviereview

25185	11440_2	  and charismatic star , 	joy	moviereview

13169	11446_2	 If A Few Good Men told us that we `` ca n't handle the truth '' than High Crimes  	disgust	moviereview
13192	11446_3	 poetically states at one point in this movie 	disgust	moviereview
13234	11447_1	 that Tom Tykwer , director of the resonant and sense-spinning Run Lola Run , has turned out to be a one-trick pony  	disgust	moviereview
13257	11447_2	 Further sad evidence 	disgust	moviereview
13279	11447_3	 -- a maker of softheaded metaphysical claptrap .  	disgust	moviereview

13322	11448_2	 You 'll trudge out of the theater feeling 	disgust	moviereview
2566	11449_1	The movie is a little tired ; maybe the original inspiration has run its course .	disgust	moviereview
25831	1144_1	  It 's a remarkably solid 	joy	moviereview
25832	1144_2	  and subtly satirical tour de force . 	joy	moviereview
13342	11450_1	 as there are moviegoers anxious to see strange young guys doing strange guy things  	joy	moviereview
13365	11450_2	 This will go on so long 	disgust	moviereview
2567	11451_1	A full-frontal attack on audience patience .	disgust	moviereview
13388	11452_1	 less sophisticated audiences will mistake it for an endorsement of the very things that Bean abhors  	disgust	moviereview
13409	11452_2	 Any intellectual arguments being made about the nature of God are framed in a drama so clumsy , there is a real danger 	disgust	moviereview
8473	11453_1	It 's a big idea , but the film itself is small and shriveled .	disgust	moviereview
2568	11454_1	Debut effort by `` Project Greenlight '' winner is sappy and amateurish .	disgust	moviereview
13431	11455_1	 One gets the impression the creators of Do n't Ask Do n't Tell 	disgust	moviereview
13472	11455_3	 laughed a hell of a lot at their own jokes .  	disgust	moviereview
2569	11456_1	Too bad none of it is funny .	disgust	moviereview
24117	11457_1	  The cast has a high time , 	joy	moviereview
24118	11457_2	  but de Broca has little enthusiasm for such antique pulp . 	disgust	moviereview
2570	11458_1	The film , like Jimmy 's routines , could use a few good laughs .	disgust	moviereview
13495	11459_1	 where it 's on slippery footing  	disgust	moviereview
13516	11459_2	 that 's especially fit for the kiddies  	joy	moviereview
13537	11459_3	 The film has too many spots 	disgust	moviereview

161	1145_1	Enormously entertaining for moviegoers of any age .	joy	moviereview
13580	11460_1	 that should be the target of something deeper and more engaging  	disgust	moviereview
13601	11460_2	 Purports to be a Hollywood satire but winds up as the kind of film 	disgust	moviereview

13624	11462_1	 who do n't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes  	disgust	moviereview
13644	11462_2	 ... in the pile of useless actioners from MTV schmucks 	disgust	moviereview
13666	11463_1	 Though it was made with careful attention to detail and is well-acted by James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal  	joy	moviereview

2571	11464_1	Humor in I Spy is so anemic .	disgust	moviereview

13727	11466_2	 , Mr. Shyamalan is undone by his pretensions .  	disgust	moviereview
13746	11467_1	 While the new film is much more eye-catching than its blood-drenched Stephen Norrington-directed predecessor 	disgust	moviereview
13768	11467_2	 the new script by the returning David  S. Goyer is much sillier .  	disgust	moviereview
22206	11468_1	  In addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history , Ballistic : Ecks Vs. Sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters 	disgust	moviereview
22207	11468_2	  and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase . 	disgust	moviereview
25187	11469_1	  It shares the first two films ' loose-jointed structure , 	disgust	moviereview
25188	11469_2	  but laugh-out-loud bits are few 	disgust	moviereview
25189	11469_3	  and far between . 	disgust	moviereview
162	1146_1	A poignant , artfully crafted meditation on mortality .	joy	moviereview

13811	11470_2	 The Santa Clause 2 is a barely adequate babysitter for older kids , but I 've got to give 	disgust	moviereview

13855	11471_2	 You can not guess 	disgust	moviereview
13878	11472_1	 the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull  	disgust	moviereview
13900	11472_2	 Barney throws away the goodwill 	disgust	moviereview

13962	11474_1	 We get the comedy we settle for  	disgust	moviereview
25190	11475_1	  The uneven movie does have its charms 	disgust	moviereview
25191	11475_2	  and its funny moments 	joy	moviereview
25192	11475_3	  but not quite enough of them . 	disgust	moviereview
22208	11476_1	  Two hours of sepia-tinted heavy metal images 	noemotion	moviereview

984	11487_1	Still , the updated Dickensian sensibility of writer Craig Bartlett 's story is appealing .	joy	moviereview
14092	11488_1	 that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at  	disgust	moviereview
14114	11488_2	 True to its title , it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations 	disgust	moviereview
14137	11489_1	 that surrounded its debut at the Sundance Film Festival two years ago  	noemotion	moviereview
14159	11489_2	 Does n't come close to justifying the hype 	disgust	moviereview
23276	1148_1	  Not only is Undercover Brother as funny , if not more so , than both Austin Powers films , 	joy	moviereview
23277	1148_2	  but it 's also one of the smarter , savvier spoofs to come along in some time . 	joy	moviereview
22212	11490_1	  The plot is paper-thin 	disgust	moviereview
22213	11490_2	  and the characters are n't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours . 	disgust	moviereview
22214	11491_1	  Kaufman 's script is never especially clever 	disgust	moviereview
22215	11491_2	  and often is rather pretentious . 	disgust	moviereview

14310	11495_2	 Any film 	disgust	moviereview
14331	11495_3	 is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss .  	disgust	moviereview
14354	11496_1	 that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves  	disgust	moviereview
14375	11496_2	 ... Blade II is still top-heavy with blazing guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts , disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves 	disgust	moviereview

14440	11498_1	 Though there are many tense scenes in Trapped  	disgust	moviereview
14462	11498_2	 , they prove more distressing than suspenseful .  	disgust	moviereview
22216	11499_1	  In this film we at least see a study in contrasts ; the wide range of one actor , 	joy	moviereview

7843	1149_1	 allow it in  	noemotion	moviereview
7844	1149_2	 In a way , the film feels like a breath of fresh air , but only to those that 	joy	moviereview
6928	114_1	 operates by the rules of its own self-contained universe  	joy	moviereview
6929	114_2	 A romantic comedy that 	noemotion	moviereview
2574	11500_1	Feels strangely hollow at its emotional core .	disgust	moviereview
14485	11501_1	 where director Adrian Lyne holds sway  	disgust	moviereview
14506	11501_2	 where all relationships are simultaneously broadly metaphorical , oddly abstract , and excruciatingly literal  	disgust	moviereview
14528	11501_3	 You have once again entered the bizarre realm 	disgust	moviereview
22218	11502_1	  The high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , 	disgust	moviereview
22219	11502_2	  and truth-in-advertising hounds take note : There 's very little hustling on view . 	disgust	moviereview
14568	11503_1	 which adds 51 minutes  	noemotion	moviereview
14588	11503_2	 This director 's cut -- 	noemotion	moviereview

2575	11504_1	Characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle .	disgust	moviereview
14631	11505_1	 like `` si , pretty much '' and `` por favor , go home '' when talking to Americans  	noemotion	moviereview
14654	11505_2	 the Venezuelans say things 	noemotion	moviereview
24119	11506_1	  That 's muy loco , 	disgust	moviereview
24120	11506_2	  but no more ridiculous than most of the rest of `` Dragonfly . '' 	disgust	moviereview
14676	11507_1	 that ends with Truckzilla  	disgust	moviereview
14697	11507_2	 It 's a movie 	noemotion	moviereview

14783	11509_1	 who needs to heal himself  	disgust	moviereview
14804	11509_2	 Director Tom Shadyac and star Kevin Costner glumly mishandle the story 's promising premise of a physician 	disgust	moviereview
29959	1150_1	 Woody Allen 's latest is an ambling , broad comedy about all there is to love -- and hate -- about the movie biz . 	joy	moviereview
22220	11510_1	  It 's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting 	disgust	moviereview
22221	11510_2	  and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 . 	disgust	moviereview
8474	11511_1	Like the Tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on	disgust	moviereview
4629	11512_1	As pedestrian as they come .	disgust	moviereview
14826	11513_1	 that plays things so nice  'n safe 	disgust	moviereview
14846	11513_2	 as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week  	disgust	moviereview
14868	11513_3	 A film 	disgust	moviereview
14909	11513_5	 blown up for the big screen .  	noemotion	moviereview
14930	11514_1	 that throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer 's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary  	disgust	moviereview
14951	11514_2	 It 's a feel-bad ending for a depressing story 	sadness	moviereview
22222	11515_1	  Put it somewhere between Sling Blade 	noemotion	moviereview
22223	11515_2	  and South of Heaven , West of Hell in the pantheon of Billy Bob 's body of work . 	joy	moviereview
1498	11516_1	More intellectually scary than dramatically involving .	fear	moviereview
2576	11517_1	An inconsequential , barely there bit of piffle .	disgust	moviereview

2577	11519_1	As saccharine as it is disposable .	disgust	moviereview
163	1151_1	It 's a stunning lyrical work of considerable force and truth .	joy	moviereview
15011	11520_1	 but that she has n't been worth caring about  	disgust	moviereview
15031	11520_2	 that Kate is n't very bright  	disgust	moviereview
15051	11520_3	 and that maybe she , Janine and Molly -- an all-woman dysfunctional family -- deserve one another  	disgust	moviereview
15072	11520_4	 You come away thinking not only 	disgust	moviereview
24121	11521_1	  The metaphors are provocative , 	disgust	moviereview
24122	11521_2	  but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery . 	disgust	moviereview
15129	11522_1	 that it appears not to have been edited at all .  	disgust	moviereview
15149	11522_2	 Very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose 	disgust	moviereview
4630	11523_1	Too much power , not enough puff .	disgust	moviereview
15167	11524_1	 that the movie has virtually nothing to show  	disgust	moviereview
15188	11524_2	 The attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact 	fear	moviereview
15208	11525_1	 that Hitler 's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances  	disgust	moviereview

19635	13163_2	 It 's been a solid half year 	joy	blog
19646	13163_3	 , and I will now attempt to encapsulate the last six months into one last epic email .  	noemotion	blog
19655	13164_1	 I believe it was April  	noemotion	blog
19676	13164_3	 , and spring had just arrived .  	noemotion	blog
19686	13165_1	 I 'll start my narrative with a little anecdote about how small the world really is  	noemotion	blog
19697	13165_2	 so I was going to work one day 	noemotion	blog
19708	13165_3	 headed to one of the hostels around Berlin to pick people up for the tour 	noemotion	blog
19715	13165_4	 and then bring them back to the Brandenburg Gate where the tour starts 	noemotion	blog
19724	13166_1	 and  as I entered and gave my little spiel about the tour and asked if anyone wanted to come along  	noemotion	blog
19734	13166_2	 I had never been to this particular hostel before 	noemotion	blog
19742	13166_3	 , I was met not with a roar of enthusiasm from the hostel residents , but rather a few dull , glass-eyed looks and was generally ignored .  	joy	blog
19751	13167_1	 As I was preparing to leave  	noemotion	blog
19759	13167_2	 , one guy over at the computers yelled out for me to wait , approached me and said hello .  	surprise	blog
19769	13168_1	 when I was  	noemotion	blog
19779	13168_2	 He had arrived twenty minutes beforehand at the hostel , had n't even checked in yet , and just happened to be in the lobby 	noemotion	blog
22344	13169_1	  We had a great time catching up , 	joy	blog
22345	13169_2	  and went out that night together as well . 	noemotion	blog
25904	1316_1	  The movie is n't just hilarious : It 's witty 	joy	moviereview
25905	1316_2	  and inventive , too , 	joy	moviereview
25906	1316_3	  and in hindsight , it is n't even all that dumb . 	joy	moviereview
19788	13170_1	 how you randomly run in to people you have n't seen in years , in little hole-in-the-walls in Europe  	noemotion	blog
19797	13170_2	 But it 's certainly strange 	noemotion	blog
22346	13171_1	  The rest of April passed rather uneventfully , 	noemotion	blog
22347	13171_2	  and in May I went to see a production of Faust Part I at the Deutsches Theater . 	noemotion	blog
19806	13172_1	 I have EVER seen  	joy	blog
19816	13172_2	 And this particular piece was by far the best play 	joy	blog
5164	13173_1	It was also incredibly simple, cutting the normally huge cast down to only seven performers.	joy	blog
19824	13174_1	 that that remind me why I 've chosen theatre as a profession  	joy	blog
19831	13174_2	 It 's moments like 	joy	blog
19841	13175_1	 I took to London at the end of May  	anticipation	blog

19859	13175_3	 . I had never been before , and had been planning on this trip for about six months .  	anticipation	blog
22348	13176_1	  I was lucky enough to be able to stay with some friends to cut down on the cost , 	joy	blog
22349	13176_2	  and see a different side of London life . 	joy	blog
22350	13177_1	  I saw most of the major sites on my own , 	noemotion	blog
22351	13177_2	  and I went to the theater almost every night I was there . 	noemotion	blog
2688	13178_1	The show was trash.	disgust	blog
2689	13179_1	Horribly acted, horribly directed, weak script.	disgust	blog
191	1317_1	Old-form moviemaking at its best .	joy	moviereview
2690	13180_1	And interminably long.	disgust	blog

19876	13181_2	 I wanted to leave at intermission , but my date was really enjoying 	disgust	blog
19886	13182_1	 I took from it was that I know now that the British are just as capable as we are of producing really awful work  	disgust	blog
19894	13182_2	 I guess the one good thing 	joy	blog
19903	13183_1	 that , just wish I did n't have to experience it first hand  	disgust	blog
19912	13183_2	 It was nice to understand 	joy	blog
22352	13184_1	  The performers were incredible , 	joy	blog
22353	13184_2	  and one of the generals was played by Geoffrey , the butler from Fresh Prince of Bellaire . 	joy	blog
22354	13185_1	  That in itself was hilarious , 	joy	blog
22355	13185_2	  and made us love the show even more . 	joy	blog
22356	13186_1	  I also saw Les Miserables for the first time , 	joy	blog
22357	13186_2	  and it was fun . 	joy	blog
19920	13187_1	 they were donated by New Zealand  	noemotion	blog
19929	13187_2	 And the funniest part , the two statues said 	joy	blog

19939	13189_1	 before the World Cup began I had actually never seen an entire soccer game from start to finish  	noemotion	blog
19948	13189_2	 Now I have a confession to make : 	noemotion	blog
192	1318_1	Ahhhh ... revenge is sweet !	joy	moviereview
19956	13190_1	 , for instance there was a three day period where we had over 90,000 Swedes in the city , leading up to their dramatic defeat at the hands of Zeh Germans  	noemotion	blog
19965	13190_2	 The hordes of people would change from day to day 	noemotion	blog
22358	13191_1	  Then there were the Brazilians , everywhere , singing-clapping-dancing-taking pictures , 	joy	blog
22359	13191_2	  and of course the pale 	noemotion	blog
22360	13191_3	  and pasty Brits with their cock-eyed stares 	disgust	blog
22361	13191_4	  and drinking songs . 	joy	blog
19974	13192_1	 that was playing to watch the match  	noemotion	blog
19984	13192_2	 I did n't have tickets to any of the games , but my group of friends would always go to a cafe or bar of the nationality 	noemotion	blog
19992	13193_1	 when Spain played  	noemotion	blog
20002	13193_2	 So to a French cafe for the France-Swiss game , a Tapas bar 	noemotion	blog
20011	13193_3	 , drank Caiprinhas with the passionate Brazilians , etc. . It was a colorful and hilarious way to take part without fighting the crowds .  	joy	blog
20021	13194_1	 how good the World Cup was for Berlin as a city , and Germany as a nation  	joy	blog
20030	13194_2	 And let me tell you 	joy	blog
20039	13195_1	 that emerged during the Cup  	noemotion	blog
20049	13195_2	 Another interesting element was the latent patriotism 	joy	blog
20058	13196_1	 before the World Cup began , if you waved a German flag in the streets  	noemotion	blog
20067	13196_2	 Now this merits explaining : 	noemotion	blog
20077	13196_3	 , you would probably be called a Nazi and at the very least labeled as a radical right wing nutter .  	disgust	blog
20085	13197_1	 that the Germans have had a really difficult time with their national identity and subsequently national pride or patriotism of any kind since the Second World War  	sadness	blog
20094	13197_2	 You have to understand 	noemotion	blog
20102	13198_1	 And for what it 's worth I agree with them  	fear	blog
20117	13198_3	 , it makes me nervous too .  	fear	blog
22362	13199_1	  People were genuinely excited about supporting their national team , 	joy	blog
22363	13199_2	  and taking pride in its accomplishments . 	joy	blog
25907	1319_2	 Yakusho and Shimizu ... create engaging characterizations in Imamura 's lively 	joy	moviereview

6943	131_3	 while deconstructing the very format of the biography in a manner that Derrida would doubtless give his blessing to 	joy	moviereview
3349	13200_1	Now this newfound enthusiasm certainly was not shared by everyone.	disgust	blog
22364	13201_1	  In fact the entire month of June was one continuous debate in the media between prominent politicians , celebrities , writers such as Guenther Grass  and Christa Wolf , 	noemotion	blog
22365	13201_3	  and other intellectuals about the meaning , origin 	noemotion	blog
22366	13201_4	  and impact of this nationalism . 	noemotion	blog
5165	13202_1	And of course no one can laboriously dissect an idea better than the Germans.	joy	blog
20127	13203_1	 that the newfound national pride was a positive thing  	joy	blog
20137	13203_2	 But the general consensus after five weeks of debate was 	joy	blog
20146	13204_1	 which I started at the end of the month  	noemotion	blog

20173	13205_2	 This camp , about 40 miles north of Berlin was the second major camp to be opened in the Nazi system , and was also used by the Russians 	noemotion	blog
20182	13206_1	 that information , and trying to put it into some kind of historical context  	anticipation	blog
20192	13206_2	 Given the dark history of such a place you can well imagine the difficulty of retelling 	disgust	blog
22367	13207_1	  After a July of beautiful weather 	joy	blog

25909	1321_1	  Ruzowitzky has taken this mothball-y stuff 	disgust	moviereview

20138	13395_2	 that our emotions are always connected to a need being met or unmet  	anticipation	blog
20156	13395_4	 we must first realize 	noemotion	blog
20165	13396_1	 why we are feeling a particular emotion  	other	blog
20174	13396_2	 that has been satisfied  	joy	blog
20183	13396_3	 By listening to our emotions and asking ourselves 	joy	blog
20193	13396_4	 we can discover an unmet need or a need 	anticipation	blog
20202	13397_1	 For instance , if I feel sad because I have not seen my family in a long time  	sadness	blog
20221	13397_3	 my need for connection has not been met .  	sadness	blog
20231	13398_1	 if I feel happy because I have spent time with my family then  	joy	blog

20297	13400_2	 and a society  that is by the most part feelings illiterate  	disgust	blog
20305	13400_3	 We live in a society 	noemotion	blog
20322	13401_1	 what we are feeling  	noemotion	blog
20331	13401_2	 Well , for starters become aware of 	noemotion	blog
20341	13402_1	 we can then go on to vocalize it  	noemotion	blog
20347	13402_2	 Once we put our finger on the emotion  	noemotion	blog
20357	13402_3	 we are feeling 	joy	blog
20366	13403_1	 that incorporates identifying our feelings  	noemotion	blog

20385	13403_3	 and needs into the model .  	noemotion	blog
20395	13404_1	 because I am needing  	noemotion	blog

22444	13406_1	  The heart is about 3 feet long 	noemotion	blog
22445	13406_2	  and 3 inches thick all around . 	noemotion	blog
20413	13407_1	 that Nonviolent communication , which focuses on feelings and needs is the language of the heart because it focuses on what is alive in the heart  	joy	blog
20421	13407_2	 The idea is 	joy	blog
22446	13408_1	  By stating our feelings 	noemotion	blog
22447	13408_2	  and needs to others we avoid blaming 	noemotion	blog
22448	13408_3	  and criticizing them . 	disgust	blog
5187	13409_1	We can then go on to making a request instead of a demand to help ourselves satisfy our now recognized need.	noemotion	blog
8010	1340_1	 Remember the kind of movie 	noemotion	moviereview
8011	1340_2	 we were hoping `` Ecks vs. Sever '' or `` xXx '' was going to be ? 	anticipation	moviereview

22449	13413_1	  By satisfying our needs 	joy	blog
22450	13413_2	  and the needs of others we can reach a fair negotiation . 	noemotion	blog
22451	13414_1	  We can make a list of these feelings 	noemotion	blog
22452	13414_2	  and be on the look out for them . 	noemotion	blog
20503	13415_1	 that we need to take a timeout when we feel these feelings to avoid a conflict  	noemotion	blog
20512	13415_2	 It may be 	noemotion	blog
20521	13416_1	 For instance , if we feel furious  	anger	blog
20538	13416_3	 it may be better to take a one hour timeout and calm down .  	anger	blog

18806	13449_1	 that even has socialists and revolutionaries saying ` hey , hold on a second  	noemotion	blog
18813	13449_2	 It 's yet another white man insensitivity subject 	disgust	blog
25921	1344_1	  The film 's almost unbearable portrait of sadness 	sadness	moviereview

22460	13451_1	  I 'm not going to get into the wrongs 	noemotion	blog
22461	13451_2	  and rights , just to give a bit of perspective . 	noemotion	blog
22462	13452_1	  I see the words veil 	noemotion	blog
22463	13452_2	  and headscarf being used by white Europeans in many contradictory contexts . 	noemotion	blog
18830	13453_1	 that covers the hair and usually wraps around the neck  	noemotion	blog
18839	13453_2	 Hijab is a headscarf 	noemotion	blog
18848	13454_1	 where womens heads are completely covered so as to see only the eyes , or in some cases nothing at all  	noemotion	blog
18858	13454_2	 The veil is often interpreted as being the ninja outfit , 	noemotion	blog
5189	13455_1	For clarification the difference should be noted.	noemotion	blog
18867	13456_1	 that women should practice modesty both for themselves  	noemotion	blog

18894	13457_1	 The veil that covers the entire face  	noemotion	blog
18913	13457_3	 is called the nikab .  	noemotion	blog

18931	13460_2	 just like the west has some Christian right wackies  	disgust	blog
18939	13460_3	 A Fatwa , or Islamic legal pronouncement makes it clear 	noemotion	blog
18948	13460_4	 - but rather this is a cultural issue within more conservative or radical interpretations of Islam 	noemotion	blog
24163	13461_1	  It most certainly raised even more anti-Muslim sentiment 	disgust	blog
24164	13461_2	  but also more anti-French sentiment even amongst it own non-Christian communities . 	disgust	blog

19097	13473_2	 It is also true 	noemotion	blog
5196	13474_1	France says no head scarves, no nothing -- look like a sexy french school girl with your belly button hanging out.	joy	blog

20369	13947_1	 I do n't bother with it  	disgust	blog

24193	13950_1	  we have no one to blame 	disgust	blog
24194	13950_2	  but our selves . 	noemotion	blog
2703	13951_1	society has become just one big stress pool.	disgust	blog
20406	13952_1	 Our conversations with family , friends , co-workers etc. 	noemotion	blog
20415	13952_2	 all seem to revolve around how crappy are day is , has been , or is going to be  	disgust	blog
20424	13952_3	 and it seems all like we compete with one another to see who has a crappier one  	disgust	blog
20459	13953_1	 where I am going with this  	noemotion	blog
20467	13953_2	 I have no clue .  	noemotion	blog
20477	13954_1	 what I want in the long run  	noemotion	blog
20487	13954_2	 I do n't have a plan , I do n't know 	noemotion	blog
20496	13955_1	 who pushes me over the edge  	anger	blog
20506	13955_2	 I love my family unconditionally , and cherish every moment with them , even my eldest sister , 	joy	blog
20515	13955_3	 , but I have developed a certain method inwhich to deal with it .  	noemotion	blog
22593	13956_1	  I have to look at life in her perspective , 	noemotion	blog
22594	13956_2	  and it would break anyones heart . 	sadness	blog
20524	13957_1	 something foreign that has stolen away your chance of a normal life 	sadness	blog
20531	13957_2	 that you can not control  	disgust	blog
20541	13957_3	 To have something inside of you 	sadness	blog
1422	13958_1	being alienated, being alone.	sadness	blog
22595	13959_1	  I can only take so much of her though , for her sake 	disgust	blog

20560	13960_1	 where I have come to know some amazing people who have such potential , but possibly will never get to put it to any use due to the cirumstances of the choices in life  	joy	blog
20570	13960_2	 I have a job 	noemotion	blog
1154	13961_1	but they make my time at work memorable.	joy	blog
22597	13962_1	  I have put my life in the hands of god , 	trust	blog
22598	13962_2	  and left him to it . 	noemotion	blog
1155	13963_1	I am happy with a casual, not serious, no pressure relationship.	joy	blog
5261	13964_1	I frankly would be just as happy alone.	joy	blog
25262	13965_1	  Still there is so much more to learn , 	noemotion	blog
25263	13965_2	  and my life is 	noemotion	blog
25264	13965_3	  but young . 	noemotion	blog
20579	13966_1	 I want to do during my time  	noemotion	blog
20587	13966_2	 I have a list of things 	noemotion	blog
20596	13966_3	 , and each day I add something new to it .  	joy	blog
20606	13967_1	 I do n't run out of time to complete it  	noemotion	blog
20616	13967_2	 laughing out loud , lets just hope 	joy	blog
20626	13968_1	 while I was in church  	noemotion	blog
20635	13968_2	 anyway I heard this 	noemotion	blog
20645	13968_3	 and it really grabbed my interest .  	joy	blog
5262	13969_1	A few days ago, I ran into this article online: http://msnbc.msn.com/id/14126192/ talking about statistics regarding the number of friends people having being at some sort of new low.	noemotion	blog
8052	1396_1	 it needs to be  	joy	moviereview
8053	1396_2	 It is amusing , and that 's all 	joy	moviereview
20653	13970_1	 the article refers to  	noemotion	blog
20663	13970_2	 in regards to having only 2 or 3 friends that would fall into the support mechanism category , if only because of circumstantial or geographical factors being taken into consideration as well  	noemotion	blog
20670	13970_3	 I guess I fit the group 	disgust	blog
22599	13971_1	  One of those 3 will be moving this fall , 	noemotion	blog
22600	13971_2	  and the others have an awful lot going on in their lives , in addition to being less available than the first by a long shot anyhow . 	disgust	blog
20688	13972_1	 and the way I've maintained them as well  	noemotion	blog
20697	13972_2	 that I 've cultivated my friendships  	noemotion	blog
20706	13972_3	 On a larger scale , this really makes me think about the way 	joy	blog
20724	13973_1	 like , moreso than any other time in my life , I 'm operating almost at the ground floor in regards to the friendships I have and the way I interact with those friends  	sadness	blog
20733	13973_2	 I definitely feel 	noemotion	blog
20743	13974_1	 which have altered my ability to fully engage some people as well , be they circumstacial or environmental or whatever 	noemotion	blog
20753	13974_2	 which have hampered my ability to be trusted as much as I 'd like to be by some of my friends  	sadness	blog
20762	13974_3	 I 've burned a lot of bridges and engaged in decisions 	sadness	blog
20772	13974_4	 , and likewise , there have been things 	noemotion	blog
20790	13975_1	 that there are a fair amount of people out there whom I would count among my friends , but limited few whom I would count as good friends , due to actions both inside and outside of my role in that friendship  	joy	blog
20799	13975_2	 Suffice to say 	sadness	blog
22601	13976_1	  We 're getting older , we have a lot more work-related matters 	noemotion	blog
22602	13976_2	  and our personal lives can get pretty complicated . 	noemotion	blog
24195	13977_1	  You build friendships as fortifications against getting too old too fast , 	noemotion	blog
24196	13977_2	  but sometimes life just catches up with you regardless of your efforts . 	fear	blog
20808	13978_1	 that I still hold the same value system that I held when I was 18 years old  	noemotion	blog
20818	13978_2	 On a big picture scale , I 'd like to believe 	joy	blog
20828	13978_3	 , now a scary half-a-lifetime ago .  	fear	blog
20837	13979_1	 what keeps you going  	noemotion	blog
18512	13979_2	 All in all , I 'm satisfied with the bigger picture and angry as fuck at the smaller details , but that 's 	joy	blog
18520	13979_3	 , is n't it .  	anger	blog
201	1397_1	Among the year 's most intriguing explorations of alientation .	joy	moviereview
18530	13980_1	 I've seen what they do to people  	noemotion	blog
18540	13980_2	 As far as support mechanisms go  	noemotion	blog
18549	13980_3	 as a bridge to help people reach things both within and outside themself that they may not have been previously able to reach  	joy	blog
18566	13980_5	 - at their best , they act 	noemotion	blog
18574	13981_1	 where you hang your hat  	noemotion	blog
18581	13981_2	 you 'd even expect to look for it  	anticipation	blog
18591	13981_3	 Home may be 	disgust	blog
18601	13981_4	 , but happiness is sometimes found far from home or in the last place 	joy	blog
18610	13982_1	 I think sometimes it can be easy to lose track of the idea 	noemotion	blog
18620	13982_2	 that happiness and comfort are two completely separate entities 	sadness	blog
19645	13982_3	 and having one does not guarantee or equal having the other some of the time , at least 	disgust	blog
18630	13983_1	 that some people only mark success by arriving at a goal , while others are capable of enjoying the efforts required to reach that goal as well  	joy	blog
18636	13983_2	 It goes back to that whole journey vs. destination idea , in 	noemotion	blog
18645	13984_1	 if the goals are similar , which one would  	noemotion	blog
18653	13984_2	 you prefer to be .  	noemotion	blog
18663	13985_1	 which are productive and goal-oriented , whereas there are also friendships that meander along the way  	noemotion	blog
18673	13985_2	 Friendship works the same way - some people only appreciate friendships 	trust	blog
18682	13985_3	 , and each moment can be as interesting and rewarding as the ones before and after .  	joy	blog
18690	13986_1	 just what a friendship really means to you , especially when it 's something you can take for granted fairly easily if you are n't careful  	disgust	blog
18699	13986_2	 It can be really difficult to appreciate 	noemotion	blog
18707	13987_1	 I know I 'm guilty of that all the time  	sadness	blog
18723	13988_1	 what we 've lost until something becomes too distant and difficult to regain  	sadness	blog
18733	13988_2	 Often we fail to realize 	sadness	blog
18742	13989_1	 which then becomes amnesia  	disgust	blog
18752	13989_2	 that ca n't be healed  	sadness	blog
18759	13989_3	 if it ever happened  	sadness	blog
18765	13989_4	 Old wounds fester into something 	disgust	blog
18773	13989_5	 , neglect becomes forgetfulness 	disgust	blog
18780	13989_6	 , and before long you wonder 	disgust	blog
202	1398_1	A full world has been presented onscreen , not some series of carefully structured plot points building to a pat resolution .	joy	moviereview
25265	13990_1	  It sucks , 	disgust	blog
25266	13990_2	  and it takes effort to keep a swerving friendship from heading down these sort of paths , 	disgust	blog
25267	13990_3	  but the effort far outweighs the consequences of failing to do so . 	disgust	blog
18790	13991_1	 It means I have some tough choices to make  	noemotion	blog
18809	13992_1	 so  whatever efforts I expend have to be met with some sort of equal efforts or the process  	anger	blog
18815	13992_2	 I can only change my own mind 	anger	blog
18823	13992_3	 goes nowhere and frustrates me the entire way .  	disgust	blog
18833	13993_1	 play out its  	joy	blog
18841	13993_2	 Is it worth it , or is it better to just let fate 	noemotion	blog
18851	13993_3	 ' hand and look for a new deal .  	anticipation	blog
18860	13994_1	 until it 's too late regardless  	noemotion	blog
18870	13994_2	 There 's usually no way to know 	noemotion	blog
18879	13995_1	 I guess I do what I can to make the most of what I have , if it 's not enough then it likely never was 	joy	blog
19654	13995_2	 and in that case , at least I know I tried  	joy	blog
18897	13996_1	 If being a friend is n't about trying  	noemotion	blog
18906	13996_2	 , then I 've been taking the wrong approach all along .  	disgust	blog
18916	13997_1	 As of late , it seems that everything my parents do  	noemotion	blog
18924	13997_2	 , they do it just to annoy me . They 're great parents .  	joy	blog
8502	13998_1	I'm not going to go into specifics here, but it almost always ends up in yelling and tears.	anger	blog
18934	13999_1	 why the hell everything turns out this way  	anger	blog
18942	13999_2	 I was thinking about our most recent spat today at dinner and wondering 	disgust	blog
203	1399_1	Seldom has a movie so closely matched the spirit of a man and his work .	joy	moviereview
25383	139_1	  Run , do n't walk , to see this barbed 	joy	moviereview

18950	14000_1	 that I want out  	noemotion	blog
18960	14000_2	 My only plausible explanation is 	disgust	blog
18970	14001_1	 how much I love them  	anticipation	blog
18980	14001_2	 No matter 	joy	blog
18987	14001_3	 , I want to be independent and living on my own , providing for myself and on the road to success .  	anticipation	blog
18996	14002_1	 that I will reach this place soon enough  	disgust	blog
19006	14002_2	 like it is taking forever  	anger	blog
19015	14002_3	 Now , I know 	anger	blog
19024	14002_4	 , but damn it feels 	anger	blog
19034	14003_1	 who 's in college to be living with their parents  	noemotion	blog
19044	14003_2	 but that does n't quell the wish to be independent and free  	anticipation	blog
19053	14003_3	 I know its normal for someone 	noemotion	blog

19099	14009_2	 further when he said My new food is making me feel really healthy  	noemotion	blog
19108	14009_3	 Further to that by the way , I did speak to him about it 	noemotion	blog

19277	14017_1	 if his definition of more important things than actually looking after yourself like an adult is n't important enough  	disgust	blog
19286	14017_2	 no wonder he does n't have a girlfrend 	disgust	blog
19296	14018_1	 what pisses me most off about the food delivery issue  	anger	blog
19306	14018_2	 is that he has chosen the easy  	anger	blog
19313	14018_3	 I think though , 	anger	blog

19389	14020_4	 , it 's just really irritating me , 	disgust	blog
19400	14020_5	 - he just is lazy .  	anger	blog
2704	14021_1	He could EASILY cook his own food - his kitchen probably cost more than half my house.	anger	blog

22614	14041_1	  I walked over to the heater as the first port of call 	noemotion	blog
22615	14041_2	  and was very surprised when ` oh ! ' it would n't turn on . 	surprise	blog
19609	14042_1	 that maybe it had broken the night before , after I 'd gone to bed or something  	noemotion	blog

22616	14043_1	  Trying to turn it back on only got me another automatic trip as lights flashed on for a brief moment , 	noemotion	blog
22617	14043_2	  and then suddenly back off . 	noemotion	blog
19630	14044_1	 until the safety was tripped  	anger	blog
19640	14044_2	 Grrrr - I then spent the next 10 minutes or so turning everything off in the house , switching the safety switch back on , and then sequentially turning everything back on 	anger	blog
19649	14045_1	 what to do , not really  	anticipation	blog

19670	14045_3	 being able to afford either a new fridge OR to fix this one .  	noemotion	blog
19680	14046_1	 but that idea was sadly left behind due to monetary issues  	sadness	blog
19691	14046_2	 about possibly buying a new fridge for themselves  	sadness	blog
19702	14046_3	 At first one of my housemates thought 	sadness	blog

19774	14052_1	 As we wrote in a recent posting , even in a favorable political climate  	sadness	blog
19784	14052_2	 Democratic candidates face a significant challenge in turning out their base voters .  	noemotion	blog
22618	14053_1	  Despite widespread dissatisfaction among Democrats with the Bush administration 	disgust	blog
22619	14053_2	  and overall Republican governance , we detect no real signs so far at least in Harris County of a groundswell to actually vote in November . 	noemotion	blog
19793	14054_1	 that this year Republicans too will have a difficult time turning out their party faithful on November 7th  	disgust	blog
19801	14054_2	 An oft-repeated notion in recent weeks , however , has been 	noemotion	blog
19811	14055_1	 that anger nationally over rising gas prices and health care costs , a protracted , expensive war with no conclusion in sight , and a perception among religious conservatives that George W. Bush has failed to deliver on the social issues that motivate them has taken a toll with GOP base voters  	anger	blog
19819	14055_2	 The argument goes 	noemotion	blog
19827	14056_1	 As noted in the latest issue of US News World Report  	noemotion	blog
19836	14056_2	 that they will vote to return their party 's elected officials to power  	trust	blog
19845	14056_3	 , new polling has Republican insiders feeling pretty darn good about turning out their folks this fall , with confidence 	joy	blog
19854	14057_1	 which highlights polling granted , six-week old polling showing the base is in line and ready to hit the polls  	noemotion	blog
19864	14057_2	 The article cites a recent strategic memo to national GOP Party Chair Ken Mehlman from Market Strategies , 	noemotion	blog
19873	14058_1	 that assumes weak Republican turnout as a key to winning is folly 	disgust	blog
19881	14058_2	 Obviously no way to tell at this point , but any Democratic victory strategy 	disgust	blog
19898	14059_1	 all the other guy 's usual folks will vote  	anticipation	blog
19908	14059_2	 In other words , the mantra for Democratic candidates this political season : persuade everyone you can  	noemotion	blog
19925	14059_4	 , turn out your base , and assume 	noemotion	blog
204	1405_1	It 's made with deftly unsettling genre flair .	joy	moviereview

5346	14650_1	It wasn't because I was sad though.	noemotion	blog
20354	14651_1	 Hey , I feel like I 'm going to pass out  	anticipation	blog
20363	14651_2	 I looked over at Jon and I said 	noemotion	blog
20373	14652_1	 my head slammed into the window behind me and I fell on the floor  	noemotion	blog
20382	14652_2	 Then I guess 	noemotion	blog
25293	14653_1	  I woke up to Jon picking up my head 	noemotion	blog
25294	14653_2	  and saying my name , 	noemotion	blog
25295	14653_3	  but I could n't hear him . 	noemotion	blog
20392	14654_1	 because I have a kidney infection that was making me dehydrated and nauseous  	disgust	blog
20400	14654_2	 It 's because of thing called vasovagal syncope and was triggered 	noemotion	blog
20410	14655_1	 I hope I can at least pass out sometime when it 's sweet  	joy	blog
20418	14655_2	 like when I 'm driving or operating heavy machinery 	noemotion	blog
20428	14656_1	 I know I have not been writing 4 a long time  	noemotion	blog
22791	14657_1	  I will never try one again 	disgust	blog
22792	14657_2	  and i suggest you do the same . 	disgust	blog
20445	14658_1	 It started raining jus B4 it started  	noemotion	blog
24231	14659_1	  I did not climb very high up 	joy	blog
24232	14659_2	  but was not bad either . 	joy	blog
25974	1465_1	  Challenging , intermittently engrossing 	joy	moviereview
25975	1465_2	  and unflaggingly creative . 	joy	moviereview
20463	14660_1	 like I always do at home to watch the national parade  	noemotion	blog
20471	14660_2	 I spent my national day 	noemotion	blog
22793	14661_1	  My school choir was taking part 	noemotion	blog
22794	14661_2	  and i saw them too . 	noemotion	blog
20481	14662_1	 I guess it 's a lot more involved than I had thought  	noemotion	blog
20500	14663_1	 Anyway , as the day proceeded it seemed to be getting easier , and I was so sure  	joy	blog
20519	14663_3	 I had the basics down pat .  	noemotion	blog
20527	14664_1	 until it was time to count my drawer  	noemotion	blog
20535	14664_2	 I felt this way up 	noemotion	blog
20545	14665_1	 that it was giving up time  	sadness	blog
20554	14665_2	 After that I had pretty much decided 	noemotion	blog
20564	14666_1	 I guess that made me feel a little bit more at ease  	joy	blog
20583	14667_1	 OF course I was stressing it too much because as the day proceeded  	noemotion	blog
20591	14667_2	 , I began to feel myself becoming more and more comfortable with everything .  	joy	blog
22795	14668_1	  The end of the day came 	noemotion	blog
22796	14668_2	  and it was than time to count out my drawer . 	noemotion	blog
20600	14669_1	 what a relief  	joy	blog
20610	14669_2	 that was for me laughing out loud  	joy	blog
20620	14669_3	 My change was exact down to the last penny , 	noemotion	blog
8306	1466_1	But it 's too long and too convoluted and it ends in a muddle .	disgust	moviereview
1177	14670_1	Today day three went relatively smoothe.	joy	blog
20639	14671_1	 since I got to hang out with Lauren the night before : -RSB- To make this somewhat shorter  	joy	blog
20649	14671_2	 But it was was n't so bad 	joy	blog
24233	14672_1	  My charges were .50 short , 	noemotion	blog
24234	14672_2	  but apparently that 's not a horrible thing . 	joy	blog
22797	14673_1	  Tomorrow I have to go in at 8 	noemotion	blog
22798	14673_2	  and stay till 5pm . 	noemotion	blog
20657	14674_1	 than for this coming week they have me down for nearly everyday till closing time  	anticipation	blog
20666	14674_2	 Urrr two more hours > . Ahh 	disgust	blog
1305	14675_1	Hopefully tomorrow will go smoothe.	anticipation	blog
22799	14676_1	  Another little check-off on the to-do list , as all three of my summer classes are now done 	joy	blog
22800	14676_2	  and graded , 	noemotion	blog
22801	14676_3	  and I still retain my 4.0 GPA . 	noemotion	blog
20674	14677_1	 I identified  when I first got back into school  	joy	blog
20682	14677_2	 than most since I 'm now past the second of the three major problem classes  	joy	blog
20692	14677_3	 It 's a bit more satisfying this time 	joy	blog
20710	14678_1	 otherwise that I ought to be able to excel at the highest level at most things  	anticipation	blog
20718	14678_2	 I assume until proven 	trust	blog
20727	14678_3	 , so a top grade in all of my classes was always the goal from day 1 .  	anticipation	blog
20737	14679_1	 I know full well I 've been between mediocre and bad at in the past - theoretical math , foreign languages , public speaking  	disgust	blog
20747	14679_2	 However , there are several things 	noemotion	blog
24423	1467_1	  The vivid lead performances sustain interest and empathy ,	joy	moviereview
24424	1467_3	  but the journey is far more interesting than the final destination . 	joy	moviereview
20757	14680_1	 class I 've been in this summer were the three classes I 've assumed  	noemotion	blog
20766	14680_2	 Thus , Statistics , mandatory Spanish , and the public speaking 	noemotion	blog
20776	14680_3	 were most likely to potentially drop my GPA .  	noemotion	blog
20785	14681_1	 I got perhaps 4 questions wrong over 5 or 6 tests in all of stats and secured an A easily in Speech  	joy	blog
20794	14681_2	 So far that 's turned out to be little problem - I believe 	noemotion	blog
20802	14682_1	 themselves were coming to me much easier than they did  	joy	blog
20812	14682_2	 What 's more  	noemotion	blog
20822	14682_3	 , I could tell the subjects 	noemotion	blog
20832	14682_4	 , say , 5 years ago - so it was n't simply a matter of more lax evaluation .  	joy	blog
20841	14683_1	 that I seem to be improving in areas which were previously more difficult  	anticipation	blog
18515	14683_2	 None of this is really an achievement of course , but it is nice to know 	disgust	blog
18524	14684_1	 that leads to me trying to further develop my natural cross-handedness into ambidexterity  	disgust	blog
18534	14684_2	 I dislike the idea of having gaps in my ability ; it 's the same need for balance 	disgust	blog
18543	14685_1	 and  so I was best served by following and developing that side of my talents  	noemotion	blog
18553	14685_2	 that I excelled verbally at potentially the highest level  	joy	blog
18561	14685_3	 I 've always been aware 	noemotion	blog
18577	14685_5	 ; but I refuse to allow that pursuit and development to leave me lopsided or with deficiencies in other areas .  	anticipation	blog
22802	14686_1	  I have a month off of classes now , to do research 	noemotion	blog
22803	14686_2	  and move 	noemotion	blog
22804	14686_3	  and probably take up an internship job . 	anticipation	blog
3432	14687_1	I'm going to have to go out to south London area police station sometime tomorrow.	noemotion	blog
18585	14688_1	 that I think the Tube will have to do do for transport  	noemotion	blog
18595	14688_2	 The weather is looking so pleasant 	joy	blog
24235	14689_1	  A little unfortunate , 	disgust	blog
24236	14689_2	  but at least it saves me from actually walking there . 	joy	blog
211	1468_1	A painfully funny ode to bad behavior .	joy	moviereview
18605	14690_1	 who 's going to watch the shop while I 'm gone  	noemotion	blog
18614	14690_2	 If it had n't been so important  	noemotion	blog
18624	14690_3	 I 'd have refused their invitation anyway - 	disgust	blog
18632	14691_1	 what could happen if  	anticipation	blog
18640	14691_2	 While I 've got every faith in my employees abilities  	trust	blog
18648	14691_3	 , I would n't like to think about 	fear	blog
18657	14692_1	 it was a wonder  he did n't pass out  	disgust	blog
18667	14692_2	 that came around off with such a red face  	surprise	blog
18677	14692_3	 I sent the last one 	noemotion	blog
18694	14693_1	 that I 'm old enough to learn lessons on my own and not from others , either by teaching or example , because people are stupid  	anger	blog
18702	14693_2	 It 's good 	joy	blog
18711	14694_1	 that most people have no concept of what turn signals , speed limits , and restroom sinks are for  	anger	blog
18719	14694_2	 Seven hours on the road in two days , and I 've come to the conclusion 	disgust	blog
18727	14695_1	 to use the bathroom on the turnpike 	noemotion	blog
18737	14695_2	 and had to wait  because it was so busy  	disgust	blog
18746	14695_3	 I stopped in New Gloucester 	noemotion	blog
18762	14696_1	 after another take a piss then leave without washing his hands  	disgust	blog
18768	14696_2	 I saw one guy 	disgust	blog
22805	14697_1	  Finally it was my turn , I use the facilities , go to the sink , find myself the only one there , 	noemotion	blog
22806	14697_2	  and a constant line of guys behind me just filing out , again without using the sink . 	disgust	blog
5347	14698_1	There wasn't even a cursory, pretend wash amounting to little more than a cold water rinse.	disgust	blog
22807	14699_1	  I finally snapped 	anger	blog
22808	14699_2	  and yelled out the door at the last two DOES ANYONE WASH THEIR FRIGGING HANDS AFTER USING THE BATHROOM ANYMORE . 	anger	blog
212	1469_1	` Easily my choice for one of the year 's best films . '	joy	moviereview
25387	146_1	  -LRB- Schweiger is -RRB- talented 	joy	moviereview

18776	14700_1	 where a number of them had congregated for a late lunch  	noemotion	blog
18784	14700_2	 Disgusted , I dried my hands , walked out , and yelled PIGS ! toward the Burger King 	disgust	blog
18794	14701_1	 where their hands have been prior to touching the same surfaces that I have , such as the toilet seat , flush lever  	disgust	blog
18803	14701_2	 While I have no doubt whatsoever that my equipment is clean and disease free I devote at least as much attention to cleaning that as I do my hands ; any women dating these boys should be weary of the possible filth that probably accompanies sexual relations with him if he ca n't even take care of his hands  	disgust	blog
18811	14701_3	 , I can not say the same for others , and can not vouch for 	disgust	blog
18819	14701_4	 , and door handles .  	noemotion	blog
18827	14702_1	 where their cold sores came from : Daddy did n't wash his hands in the restroom , then he  	disgust	blog
18836	14702_2	 Hey assholes , explain to your children 	anger	blog
18845	14702_3	 cleaned the ketchup off your face , and now you have herpes .  	disgust	blog
18855	14703_1	 while it 's unlikely that you 'll catch something major from a dirty turnpike restroom  	fear	blog
18864	14703_2	 Old guy , 	noemotion	blog
18873	14703_3	 , even a case of the flu could kill at your age .  	noemotion	blog
2715	14704_1	UNCLEAN! should at the very least be a public restroom on the interstate.	disgust	blog
22809	14705_1	  Simply entering one should make you feel dirty 	disgust	blog
22810	14705_2	  and in want of a shower . 	noemotion	blog
3433	14706_1	We saw Descent at the local 'ghetto' theater, in the local 'ghetto' mall.	disgust	blog
18883	14707_1	 like the Airport Mall here in Bangor : the automatic doors , for instance , are n't necessarily automatic anymore  	noemotion	blog
18891	14707_2	 You know , it 's 	noemotion	blog
18901	14708_1	 that much more , the former Hoyt 's and even the cheap seats at Spotlight in Orono all have the new stadium seats , bigger screens , and latest sound tech  	joy	blog
18910	14708_2	 It makes me appreciate the local cinemas 	joy	blog
8510	14709_1	But it was nice to get out to the movies with Holly, I don't get to see her very much at all in any role other than as mom, and as a single male with no kids, it's hard to associate myself with parents.	joy	blog
213	1470_1	Charles ' entertaining film chronicles Seinfeld 's return to stand-up comedy after the wrap of his legendary sitcom , alongside wannabe comic Adams ' attempts to get his shot at the big time .	joy	moviereview
22811	14710_1	  Ask any comedian , they usually have a bit about the inability of the childless to relate to parents 	noemotion	blog
22812	14710_2	  and vice versa . 	noemotion	blog
18918	14711_1	 Not that Erin has a problem  	noemotion	blog
18928	14711_2	 , she loves kids and works with them , but I 've never honestly been much of a kid person .  	noemotion	blog
24237	14712_1	  Older kids , sure , I can identify with short , immature 	disgust	blog
24238	14712_2	  but otherwise rational human beings , 	disgust	blog
24239	14712_3	  but little kids . 	noemotion	blog
18937	14713_1	 when someone three feet tall smacks me in the head  	anger	blog
18946	14713_2	 What do I do 	noemotion	blog
25296	14714_1	  You ca n't beat them , you ca n't yell 	noemotion	blog
25297	14714_2	  and foam at the mouth , 	other	blog
25298	14714_3	  but you ca n't ignore it either . 	disgust	blog
18954	14715_1	 that you ca n't just go around pissing people off  	joy	blog
18964	14715_2	 But unlike that said territory , children grow-up at some point , and most at least realize 	noemotion	blog
18974	14716_1	 Though they undoubtedly do  	noemotion	blog
18991	14717_1	 that you might otherwise associate with a Hollywood movie that stars an entire cast of nothing but athletic women  	disgust	blog
19000	14717_2	 The plot was just full of loopholes , there was n't even any gratuitous boobage 	disgust	blog
19010	14718_1	 oh I 'm cute  	disgust	blog
19019	14718_2	 No , these were n't the 	disgust	blog
19028	14718_3	 , see my ta-tas ? kind of athleticly built women , these were the see me hang from the roof of a cave by my fingernails type , the I do n't even need a sportsbra kind of actual athletes .  	disgust	blog
19038	14719_1	 that you could drive a truck through  	noemotion	blog
19047	14719_2	 But this one was just full of plot holes 	disgust	blog
25976	1471_1	  That dogged good will of the parents 	joy	moviereview
25977	1471_2	  and ` vain ' Jia 's defoliation of ego , make the film touching despite some doldrums . 	joy	moviereview
19057	14720_1	 IF you actually want to see The Descent then  	disgust	blog
19066	14720_2	 stop here and go do your nails or something .  	disgust	blog
5348	14721_1	Ok, so at one point they find a dead moose in the middle of the cave system.	noemotion	blog
22813	14722_1	  Oh they kill the food outside 	noemotion	blog
22814	14722_2	  and bring it inside to eat . 	noemotion	blog
3434	14723_1	And what about the primitive cave paintings by the local natives thousands of years ago.	noemotion	blog
22815	14724_1	  I do n't find the idea of poking around in the dark deep in the bowels of the earth very entertaining at all , I do n't think our ancestors , devoid of electric flashlights 	disgust	blog
22816	14724_2	  and safety equipment would be any more inclined to risking their life for so worthless an enterprise . 	disgust	blog
3435	14725_1	Is there food that deep in the cave.	noemotion	blog
19076	14726_1	 that prayed upon human beings so very long ago  	noemotion	blog
19085	14726_2	 before we took to cave drawing  	disgust	blog
19094	14726_3	 If this took place in the wilds of Africa  	disgust	blog
19103	14726_4	 , perhaps it might be worth venturing into the earth to escape the large predators 	noemotion	blog
19112	14726_5	 , but even that was well 	noemotion	blog
19122	14727_1	 as to all the different ways it was just simply retarded  	disgust	blog
19132	14727_2	 After the movie and the subsequent discussion 	disgust	blog
19140	14727_3	 , we came back to the house and watched TiVo .  	noemotion	blog
22817	14728_1	  Holly 's gotten really into Dog the Bounty Hunter 	noemotion	blog
22818	14728_2	  and we watched an episode of that . 	noemotion	blog
19150	14729_1	 that I enjoy it if there 's really nothing else to watch  	joy	blog

19190	14731_2	 I 'm already convinced 	noemotion	blog

24240	14732_1	  Major Victory is entertaining , 	joy	blog

22819	14733_1	  Black suits for Spiderman 	noemotion	blog

19207	14734_1	 Reeves was a fatman in tights with no issues  	disgust	blog
19217	14734_2	 Look at Superman : the original television 	disgust	blog

5349	14736_1	We watch tube for a few hours, I watch Holly fold clothes, I head to bed in the basement then get up the next morning to watch Spiderman 2 with her and the kids.	noemotion	blog
22821	14737_1	  The turnpike was nuts , every asshole from Jersey 	disgust	blog
22822	14737_2	  and Connecticut was apparently heading to Canada . 	disgust	blog

19264	14739_1	 of which I experienced the last time  	noemotion	blog

19290	14741_1	 since Route One was pretty packed  	noemotion	blog
19300	14741_2	 Come Scarborough , I jumped back on , 	noemotion	blog
19308	14741_3	 , and I did n't want to go through downtown Portland .  	noemotion	blog
19317	14742_1	 after the traffic jam cleared , and ended up getting home 4 hours later than expected and having just enough time to get ready for work before heading out again  	noemotion	blog
19326	14742_2	 I abandoned the turnpike last time as well , shortly 	noemotion	blog
19335	14743_1	 where they should have been  	noemotion	blog
19344	14743_2	 So back on the pike , putting up with traffic , speeds picked up to well above 	noemotion	blog
19354	14743_3	 , things cleared a little north of Lewiston , a little more above Augusta , but it was still pretty frigging busy all the way up .  	anger	blog

24756	5817_2	  and emotionally disintegrating over the course of the movie has a certain poignancy in light of his recent death , 	disgust	moviereview
24757	5817_3	  but Boyd 's film offers little else of consequence . 	disgust	moviereview
12357	5818_1	 that this film , like the similarly ill-timed Antitrust , is easily as bad at a fraction the budget  	disgust	moviereview

12370	5827_1	 that only self-aware neurotics engage in  	disgust	moviereview
12371	5827_2	 Full of the kind of obnoxious chitchat 	disgust	moviereview

80	582_1	Hilarious , acidic Brit comedy .	joy	moviereview
12376	5830_1	 that takes too long to shake  	disgust	moviereview

12379	5831_2	 , find an escape clause and avoid seeing this trite , predictable rehash .  	disgust	moviereview
12380	5832_2	 The director and her capable cast appear to be caught in a heady whirl of New Age-inspired good intentions 	disgust	moviereview

12382	5835_1	 title sequence is the funniest 5 minutes to date in this spy comedy franchise ... Then Mike Myers shows up and ruins everything  	disgust	moviereview

27952	5837_2	  and unappealing to care about . 	disgust	moviereview
12386	5838_1	 So genial is the conceit  	joy	moviereview
12387	5838_2	 that you root for throughout , dearly hoping that the rich promise of the script will be realized on the screen  	joy	moviereview
12388	5838_4	 , this is one of those rare pictures 	joy	moviereview
4050	5839_1	It never is , not fully .	noemotion	moviereview
23226	583_1	  As a revenge thriller , the movie is serviceable , 	disgust	moviereview

1632	5966_1	Astonishing is n't the word -- neither is incompetent , incoherent or just plain crap .	disgust	moviereview
12513	5967_1	 that is Deuces Wild  	noemotion	moviereview
12514	5967_2	 Indeed , none of these words really gets at the very special type of badness 	disgust	moviereview
4068	5968_1	One thing is for sure : This movie does not tell you a whole lot about Lily Chou-Chou .	disgust	moviereview
12515	5969_1	 the material needs  	noemotion	moviereview
12516	5969_2	 With a tone as variable as the cinematography , Schaeffer 's film never settles into the light-footed enchantment 	disgust	moviereview
12517	5969_3	 , and the characters ' quirks and foibles never jell into charm .  	joy	moviereview
7353	596_1	 I had watching McGrath 's version  	noemotion	moviereview
7354	596_2	 Having never been a huge fan of Dickens ' 800-page novel , it surprised me how much pleasure 	joy	moviereview
12518	5970_1	 why this did n't connect with me  	disgust	moviereview
12519	5970_2	 that in itself is commentary enough  	noemotion	moviereview
12520	5970_3	 To better understand 	noemotion	moviereview
12521	5970_4	 would require another viewing , and I wo n't be sitting through this one again ... 	disgust	moviereview
23617	5971_1	  Cuba Gooding Jr. valiantly mugs his way through Snow Dogs , 	disgust	moviereview
23618	5971_2	  but even his boisterous energy fails to spark this leaden comedy . 	disgust	moviereview
1633	5972_1	Diane Lane 's sophisticated performance ca n't rescue Adrian Lyne 's Unfaithful from its sleazy moralizing .	disgust	moviereview
12522	5973_1	 I doubt it would be all that interesting  	disgust	moviereview
12523	5973_2	 what it 's trying to say  	noemotion	moviereview
12524	5973_3	 and  even if it were  	noemotion	moviereview
12525	5973_4	 Not at all clear 	disgust	moviereview
12526	5974_1	 who is too crazy to be interesting  	disgust	moviereview
12527	5974_2	 -LRB- Swimfan -RRB- falls victim to sloppy plotting , an insultingly unbelievable final act and a villainess 	disgust	moviereview
12528	5975_1	 eroti-comedy might just be the biggest husband-and-wife disaster since John and Bo Derek  	disgust	moviereview
12529	5975_2	 This remake of Lina Wertmuller 's 1975 	noemotion	moviereview
12530	5975_3	 made the ridiculous Bolero .  	disgust	moviereview
8403	5976_1	Silly , loud and goofy .	joy	moviereview
12531	5977_1	 you can get for a buck or so in that greasy little vidgame pit in the theater lobby  	disgust	moviereview
12532	5977_2	 Why spend $ 9 on the same stuff 	noemotion	moviereview
12533	5978_1	 that , half an hour in , starts making water torture seem appealing  	disgust	moviereview
12534	5978_2	 The French director has turned out nearly 21/2 hours of unfocused , excruciatingly tedious cinema 	disgust	moviereview
24770	5979_1	  The basic premise is intriguing 	disgust	moviereview
24771	5979_2	  but quickly becomes distasteful 	disgust	moviereview
24772	5979_3	  and downright creepy . 	disgust	moviereview
7355	597_1	 itself operates  	noemotion	moviereview
7356	597_2	 The best thing the film does is to show us not only what that mind looks like , but how the creative process 	joy	moviereview
1634	5980_1	The Pool drowned me in boredom .	disgust	moviereview
1635	5981_1	It 's like an all-star salute to Disney 's cheesy commercialism .	disgust	moviereview
12535	5982_1	 that makes as much of a mess as this one  	disgust	moviereview
12536	5982_2	 It 's hard to imagine any recent film , independent or otherwise , 	noemotion	moviereview
24773	5983_1	  Some of the computer animation is handsome , 	joy	moviereview
24774	5983_2	  and various amusing sidekicks add much-needed levity to the otherwise bleak tale , 	disgust	moviereview
24775	5983_3	  but overall the film never rises above mediocrity . 	disgust	moviereview
1369	5984_1	There 's an excellent 90-minute film here ; unfortunately , it runs for 170 .	disgust	moviereview
12537	5985_1	 As saccharine movies go  	noemotion	moviereview
12538	5985_2	 if taken in large doses  	noemotion	moviereview
12539	5985_3	 , this is likely to cause massive cardiac arrest 	disgust	moviereview
12540	5986_1	 you grew up with  	noemotion	moviereview
12541	5986_2	 but it 's hard not to be a sucker for its charms  	joy	moviereview
12542	5986_3	 Die Another Day is only intermittently entertaining 	disgust	moviereview
12543	5986_4	 , or perhaps it 's just impossible not to feel nostalgia for movies 	joy	moviereview
12544	5987_1	 than it can comfortably hold  	disgust	moviereview
12545	5987_2	 As is often the case with ambitious , eager first-time filmmakers  	disgust	moviereview
12546	5987_3	 , Mr. Murray , a prolific director of music videos , stuffs his debut with more plot 	noemotion	moviereview
12547	5988_1	 how a rich historical subject , combined with so much first-rate talent ... could have yielded such a flat , plodding picture  	disgust	moviereview
12548	5988_2	 The mystery of Enigma is 	noemotion	moviereview
12549	5989_1	 if to say , `` Look at this  	noemotion	moviereview
12550	5989_2	 It throws quirky characters , odd situations , and off-kilter dialogue at us , all as 	disgust	moviereview
82	598_1	For all its failed connections , Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood is nurturing , in a gauzy , dithering way .	disgust	moviereview
895	5990_1	This is an interesting movie ! ''	joy	moviereview
1636	5991_1	But the film itself is ultimately quite unengaging .	disgust	moviereview
1637	5992_1	The inherent limitations of using a video game as the source material movie are once again made all too clear in this schlocky horror/action hybrid .	disgust	moviereview
12551	5993_1	 because we 've seen -LRB- Eddie -RRB- Murphy do the genial-rogue shtick to death , but because the plot is equally hackneyed  	disgust	moviereview
12552	5993_2	 It 's not only dull 	disgust	moviereview
1638	5994_1	Avary 's film never quite emerges from the shadow of Ellis ' book .	disgust	moviereview
12553	5995_1	 that forgets about unfolding a coherent , believable story in its zeal to spread propaganda  	disgust	moviereview
12554	5995_2	 A poorly scripted , preachy fable 	disgust	moviereview
12555	5996_1	 While it is interesting to witness the conflict from the Palestinian side  	noemotion	moviereview
12556	5996_2	 , Longley 's film lacks balance ... and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context .  	disgust	moviereview
12557	5997_2	 Steven Spielberg got it right the first time  	noemotion	moviereview
12558	5997_3	 Woo has as much right to make a huge action sequence as any director , 	joy	moviereview
12559	5997_4	 but how long will filmmakers copy the `` Saving Private Ryan '' battle scenes before realizing 	disgust	moviereview
23619	5998_1	  It 's sincere to a fault , 	joy	moviereview
23620	5998_2	  but , unfortunately , not very compelling or much fun . 	disgust	moviereview
12560	5999_1	 that , its title notwithstanding , should have been a lot nastier  	disgust	moviereview
12561	5999_2	 if it wanted to fully capitalize on its lead 's specific gifts  	noemotion	moviereview
12562	5999_3	 ... Jones , despite a definitely distinctive screen presence , just is n't able to muster for a movie 	disgust	moviereview
12563	5999_4	 if it wanted to fully capitalize on its lead 's specific gifts .  	disgust	moviereview
1542	599_1	This is pretty dicey material .	disgust	moviereview
25351	59_1	  Behind the snow games 	noemotion	moviereview
25352	59_2	  and lovable Siberian huskies -LRB- plus one sheep dog -RRB- , the picture hosts a parka-wrapped dose of heart . 	joy	moviereview
6818	5_1	 If you sometimes like to go to the movies to have fun  	joy	moviereview
6819	5_2	 Wasabi is a good place to start . 	joy	moviereview
12564	6000_1	 that it makes one long for a geriatric Peter  	noemotion	moviereview
12565	6000_2	 This follow-up seems so similar to the 1953 Disney classic 	disgust	moviereview
12566	6001_1	 when the TV cow is free  	noemotion	moviereview
12567	6001_2	 Why , you may ask  	noemotion	moviereview
12568	6001_3	 , why should you buy the movie milk 	noemotion	moviereview
4069	6002_1	There 's no good answer to that one .	noemotion	moviereview
12569	6003_1	 as he defecates in bed and urinates on the plants at his own birthday party  	noemotion	moviereview
12570	6003_2	 This slow-moving Swedish film offers not even a hint of joy , preferring to focus on the humiliation of Martin 	sadness	moviereview
12571	6004_1	 that does n't make much sense even on its own terms  	disgust	moviereview
12572	6004_2	 A muddled limp biscuit of a movie , a vampire soap opera 	disgust	moviereview
12573	6005_1	 that made me want to scream  	disgust	moviereview
12574	6005_2	 There 's the plot , and a maddeningly insistent and repetitive piano score 	disgust	moviereview
12575	6006_1	 that it churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action  	disgust	moviereview
12576	6006_2	 This is a movie so insecure about its capacity to excite 	disgust	moviereview
1639	6007_1	This is amusing for about three minutes .	disgust	moviereview
27983	6008_1	  Klein , charming in comedies like American Pie 	joy	moviereview
27984	6008_2	  and dead-on in Election , delivers one of the saddest action hero performances ever witnessed . 	disgust	moviereview
12577	6009_1	 that takes such a speedy swan dive from `` promising ''  	disgust	moviereview
12578	6009_2	 It 's rare to see a movie 	noemotion	moviereview
12579	6009_3	 to `` interesting '' to `` familiar '' before landing squarely on `` stupid '' .  	disgust	moviereview
8290	600_1	But some unexpected zigs and zags help .	joy	moviereview
12580	6010_1	 that usually goes straight to video  	noemotion	moviereview
12581	6010_2	 This is the sort of low-grade dreck 	disgust	moviereview
12582	6010_3	 -- with a lousy script , inept direction , pathetic acting , poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography , complete with visible boom mikes .  	disgust	moviereview
12583	6011_1	 who is chasing who or why 	noemotion	moviereview
12584	6011_2	 The direction occasionally rises to the level of marginal competence , but for most of the film it is hard to tell 	disgust	moviereview
12585	6012_1	 than seeing an otherwise good movie marred beyond redemption by a disastrous ending  	disgust	moviereview
12586	6012_2	 There are few things more frustrating to a film buff 	disgust	moviereview
24776	6013_1	  It wo n't harm anyone , 	disgust	moviereview
24777	6013_2	  but neither can I think of a very good reason to rush right out 	disgust	moviereview
24778	6013_3	  and see it . 	disgust	moviereview
27985	6014_1	  After all , it 'll probably be in video stores by Christmas , 	noemotion	moviereview
27986	6014_2	  and it might just be better suited to a night in the living room than a night at the movies . 	disgust	moviereview
12587	6015_1	 who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independent-community guiding lights  	disgust	moviereview
12588	6015_2	 Looks more like a travel-agency video targeted at people 	disgust	moviereview
12589	6016_1	 that it is  	disgust	moviereview
12590	6016_2	 Given too much time to consider the looseness of the piece , the picture begins to resemble the shapeless , grasping actors ' workshop 	disgust	moviereview
12591	6017_1	 that would make this a moving experience for people who have n't read the book  	joy	moviereview
12592	6017_2	 They kept much of the plot but jettisoned the stuff 	disgust	moviereview
12593	6018_1	 it 's good enough for our girls  	joy	moviereview
12594	6018_2	 Just because A Walk to Remember is shrewd enough to activate girlish tear ducts  	disgust	moviereview
12595	6018_3	 does n't mean 	noemotion	moviereview
12596	6019_1	 are both overplayed and exaggerated , but then again  	disgust	moviereview
12597	6019_2	 -LRB- Carvey 's -RRB- characters 	disgust	moviereview
12598	6019_3	 , subtlety has never been his trademark .  	disgust	moviereview
7357	601_1	 nature holds for many urban dwellers  	joy	moviereview
7358	601_2	 The filmmakers skillfully evoke the sense of menace that 	joy	moviereview
12599	6020_1	 that plays out here  	noemotion	moviereview
12600	6020_2	 that few will bother thinking it all through  	noemotion	moviereview
12601	6020_3	 It 's mildly interesting to ponder the peculiar American style of justice 	joy	moviereview
12602	6020_4	 , but it 's so muddled and derivative 	disgust	moviereview
27987	6021_1	  This dreadfully earnest inversion of the Concubine love triangle eschews the previous film 's historical panorama 	disgust	moviereview
27988	6021_2	  and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging 	disgust	moviereview
27989	6021_3	  and gay-niche condescension . 	disgust	moviereview
23621	6022_1	  Brown 's saga , like many before his , makes for snappy prose 	disgust	moviereview
23622	6022_2	  but a stumblebum of a movie . 	disgust	moviereview
27990	6023_1	  The boys ' sparring , like the succession of blows dumped on Guei , wears down the story 's more cerebral , 	disgust	moviereview
27991	6023_2	  and likable , plot elements . 	disgust	moviereview
4070	6024_1	The script by Vincent R. Nebrida ... tries to cram too many ingredients into one small pot .	disgust	moviereview
12603	6025_1	 that were it a Macy 's Thanksgiving Day Parade balloon  	noemotion	moviereview
12604	6025_2	 The story is so light and sugary 	joy	moviereview
12605	6025_3	 , extra heavy-duty ropes would be needed to keep it from floating away .  	disgust	moviereview
27992	6026_1	  Oedekerk mugs mercilessly , 	disgust	moviereview
27993	6026_2	  and the genuinely funny jokes are few 	disgust	moviereview
27994	6026_3	  and far between . 	noemotion	moviereview
12606	6027_1	 Since Dahmer resorts to standard slasher flick thrills when it should be most in the mind of the killer  	noemotion	moviereview
12607	6027_2	 , it misses a major opportunity to be truly revelatory about his psyche .  	disgust	moviereview
1640	6028_1	Only those most addicted to film violence in all its forms will find anything here to appreciate .	disgust	moviereview
896	6029_1	Cold and scattered , Minority Report commands interest almost solely as an exercise in gorgeous visuals .	disgust	moviereview
7359	602_1	 Russell and Dreyfus are a romantic pairing of hearts , preciously exposed as history corners them  	joy	moviereview
7360	602_2	 The laser-projected paintings provide a spell-casting beauty , while 	joy	moviereview
12608	6030_1	 that , finally , is minimally satisfying  	disgust	moviereview
12609	6030_2	 That 's not vintage Spielberg and 	disgust	moviereview
27995	6031_1	  Every now 	disgust	moviereview
27996	6031_2	  and again , a movie comes along to remind us of how very bad a motion picture can truly be . 	disgust	moviereview
2845	6032_1	Frank McKlusky C.I. is that movie !	noemotion	moviereview
1641	6033_1	It 's not difficult to spot the culprit early-on in this predictable thriller .	disgust	moviereview
12610	6034_1	 that 's likely to irk viewers  	disgust	moviereview
12611	6034_2	 ... a mostly boring affair with a confusing sudden finale 	disgust	moviereview
12612	6035_1	 you might as well be watching a rerun  	disgust	moviereview
12613	6035_2	 The trappings of I Spy are so familiar 	disgust	moviereview
12614	6036_1	 What starts off as a potentially incredibly twisting mystery  	disgust	moviereview
12615	6036_2	 becomes simply a monster chase film .  	disgust	moviereview
27997	6037_1	  In the wake of Saving Private Ryan , Black Hawk Down 	disgust	moviereview
27998	6037_2	  and We Were Soldiers , you are likely to be as heartily sick of mayhem as Cage 's war-weary marine . 	disgust	moviereview
1642	6038_1	It is messy , uncouth , incomprehensible , vicious and absurd .	disgust	moviereview
4071	6039_1	Really does feel like a short stretched out to feature length .	disgust	moviereview
3623	603_1	You do n't have to be an especially tough grader to give a charitable B-minus to The Emperor 's Club .	disgust	moviereview
27999	6040_1	  Hampered -- no , paralyzed -- by a self-indulgent script ... that aims for poetry 	disgust	moviereview
28000	6040_2	  and ends up sounding like satire . 	disgust	moviereview
12616	6041_1	 that crawls along at a snail 's pace  	disgust	moviereview
12617	6041_2	 Cheap , vulgar dialogue and a plot 	disgust	moviereview
12618	6042_1	 that is a self-glorified Martin Lawrence lovefest  	disgust	moviereview
12619	6042_2	 And if you appreciate the one-sided theme to Lawrence 's over-indulgent tirade  	disgust	moviereview
12620	6042_4	 , then knock yourself out and enjoy the big screen postcard 	joy	moviereview
12621	6043_1	 If you are willing to do this , then you so crazy  	surprise	moviereview
1643	6044_1	Directed without the expected flair or imagination by Hong Kong master John Woo , Windtalkers airs just about every cliche in the war movie compendium across its indulgent two-hour-and-fifteen-minute length .	disgust	moviereview
28001	6045_1	  It 's a very tasteful rock 	joy	moviereview
28002	6045_2	  and roll movie . 	joy	moviereview
2846	6046_1	You could put it on a coffee table anywhere .	noemotion	moviereview
24779	6047_1	  The movie is loaded with good intentions , 	disgust	moviereview
24780	6047_2	  but in his zeal to squeeze the action 	disgust	moviereview
24781	6047_3	  and our emotions into the all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the Holocaust escape story , Minac drains his movie of all individuality . 	disgust	moviereview
1457	6048_1	An infuriating film .	anger	moviereview
12622	6049_1	 Just when you think you are making sense of it  	noemotion	moviereview
12623	6049_2	 that tells you there is no sense  	noemotion	moviereview
12624	6049_3	 , something happens 	noemotion	moviereview
25581	604_1	  This romantic thriller is steeped in the atmosphere of wartime England , 	joy	moviereview

25583	604_3	  and ideals of the 1940s . 	joy	moviereview
12625	6050_1	 that it 's hardly over before it begins to fade from memory  	disgust	moviereview
12626	6050_2	 The entire movie is so formulaic and forgettable 	disgust	moviereview
12627	6051_1	 which never reach satisfying conclusions  	disgust	moviereview
12628	6051_2	 The setting turns out to be more interesting than any of the character dramas , 	disgust	moviereview
1644	6052_1	As an entertainment destination for the general public , Kung Pow sets a new benchmark for lameness .	disgust	moviereview
28003	6053_1	  This misty-eyed Southern nostalgia piece , in treading the line between sappy 	disgust	moviereview
28004	6053_2	  and sanguine , winds up mired in tear-drenched quicksand . 	disgust	moviereview
1645	6054_1	As pure over-the-top trash , any John Waters movie has it beat by a country mile .	disgust	moviereview
23623	6055_1	  Wendigo wants to be a monster movie for the art-house crowd , 	disgust	moviereview
23624	6055_2	  but it falls into the trap of pretention almost every time . 	disgust	moviereview
28005	6056_1	  Bigelow offers some flashy twists 	joy	moviereview
28006	6056_2	  and turns that occasionally fortify this turgid fable . 	disgust	moviereview
12629	6057_1	 that stalls in its lackluster gear of emotional blandness  	disgust	moviereview
12630	6057_2	 But for the most part , The Weight of Water comes off as a two-way time-switching myopic mystery 	disgust	moviereview
2847	6058_1	This film biggest problem ?	disgust	moviereview
4072	6059_1	No laughs .	disgust	moviereview

7362	605_2	 Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood may not be exactly divine , but it 's definitely -- defiantly -- ya ya , what 	joy	moviereview
1646	6060_1	Less-than-compelling documentary of a Yiddish theater clan .	disgust	moviereview
12631	6061_1	 That the Chuck Norris `` grenade gag ''  	noemotion	moviereview
12632	6061_2	 occurs about 7 times during Windtalkers is a good indication of how serious-minded the film is  	joy	moviereview
12633	6062_1	 that were it not for Holm 's performance  	disgust	moviereview
12634	6062_2	 Viewers are asked so often to suspend belief 	trust	moviereview
12635	6062_3	 , the film would be a total washout .  	disgust	moviereview

12654	6073_1	 that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today 's Hollywood  	disgust	moviereview
12655	6073_2	 The result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage 	disgust	moviereview

28015	6103_1	  It 's a glorified sitcom , 	disgust	moviereview

12698	6106_2	 Devoid of any of the qualities 	disgust	moviereview

2848	6111_1	It 's sort of a 21st century morality play with a Latino hip hop beat .	noemotion	moviereview
4078	6112_1	But the second half of the movie really goes downhill .	disgust	moviereview
12706	6113_1	 what is in many ways a fresh and dramatically substantial spin on the genre  	joy	moviereview
12707	6113_2	 Paxton 's uneven directorial debut fails to unlock the full potential of 	disgust	moviereview
28019	6114_1	  The script becomes lifeless 	disgust	moviereview

4079	6119_1	Alternately frustrating and rewarding .	disgust	moviereview
83	611_1	A historical epic with the courage of its convictions about both scope and detail .	joy	moviereview

12735	6137_3	 Children of the Century , 	disgust	moviereview
12736	6137_4	 , ultimately falls prey to the contradiction 	disgust	moviereview
28021	6138_1	  It 's not so much a movie as a joint promotion for the National Basketball Association 	disgust	moviereview
28022	6138_2	  and teenaged rap 	disgust	moviereview

1701	6347_1	Guy gets girl , guy loses girl , audience falls asleep .	disgust	moviereview

24804	6373_2	  and opaque ... an interesting technical exercise , 	disgust	moviereview

28091	6386_1	  Seagal ran out of movies years ago , 	disgust	moviereview
28092	6386_2	  and this is just the proof . 	disgust	moviereview
12980	6387_1	 that , come to think of it , the day-old shelf would be a more appropriate location to store it  	disgust	moviereview
12981	6387_2	 The movie is so contrived , nonsensical and formulaic 	disgust	moviereview
12982	6388_1	 that diverges from anything remotely probing or penetrating  	disgust	moviereview
12983	6388_2	 An awkwardly garish showcase 	disgust	moviereview

28099	6405_1	  I have returned from the beyond to warn you : this movie is 90 minutes long , 	disgust	moviereview
28100	6405_2	  and life is too short . 	disgust	moviereview
23649	6406_1	  There are some fairly unsettling scenes , 	fear	moviereview

13007	6409_1	 that never rises above superficiality  	disgust	moviereview
13008	6409_2	 A straight-ahead thriller 	joy	moviereview
7386	640_1	 another great ` what you do n't see  ' is much more terrifying  	joy	moviereview

8410	6410_1	Glizty but formulaic and silly ... Cagney 's ` top of the world ' has been replaced by the bottom of the barrel .	disgust	moviereview
13009	6411_1	 The re - enactments , however fascinating they may be as history  	joy	moviereview
13010	6411_3	 , are too crude to serve the work especially well .  	disgust	moviereview
1707	6412_1	Is anyone else out there getting tired of the whole slo-mo , double-pistoled , ballistic-pyrotechnic Hong Kong action aesthetic ?	disgust	moviereview
13011	6413_1	 that stifles creativity and allows the film to drag on for nearly three hours  	disgust	moviereview
13012	6413_2	 Once again , director Chris Columbus takes a hat-in-hand approach to Rowling 	disgust	moviereview
1708	6414_1	Serving Sara is little more than a mall movie designed to kill time .	disgust	moviereview
13013	6415_1	 that ends up slapping  	disgust	moviereview

13016	6416_1	 whose hero gives his heart only to the dog  	noemotion	moviereview
13017	6416_2	 A well-made but emotionally scattered film 	joy	moviereview
28101	6417_1	  The most repugnant adaptation of a classic text since Roland Joff 	disgust	moviereview
28102	6417_2	  and Demi Moore 's The Scarlet Letter . 	disgust	moviereview
1709	6418_1	The isolated moments of creative insanity finally are lost in the thin soup of canned humor .	disgust	moviereview
1710	6419_1	As a movie , it never seems fresh and vital .	disgust	moviereview
7389	641_1	 is tortured and unsettling -- but unquestionably alive  	joy	moviereview
7390	641_2	 A carefully structured scream of consciousness that 	joy	moviereview

13019	6420_2	 It never plays as dramatic 	noemotion	moviereview
1711	6421_1	It labours as storytelling .	disgust	moviereview
1712	6422_1	The Adventures of Pluto Nash is a whole lot of nada .	disgust	moviereview
1713	6423_1	A really good premise is frittered away in middle-of-the-road blandness .	disgust	moviereview

13021	6426_2	 Despite the fact 	noemotion	moviereview
13022	6426_3	 , it 's still not a good movie  	disgust	moviereview
28103	6427_1	  A well made indieflick in need of some trims 	joy	moviereview
28104	6427_2	  and a more chemistry between its stars . 	disgust	moviereview
13023	6428_1	 I 'd say this  	noemotion	moviereview
13024	6428_2	 I never thought 	noemotion	moviereview
13025	6428_3	 , but I 'd much rather watch teens poking their genitals into fruit pies !  	disgust	moviereview
1715	6429_1	A film neither bitter nor sweet , neither romantic nor comedic , neither warm nor fuzzy .	disgust	moviereview
25601	642_1	  A quietly reflective 	joy	moviereview
25602	642_2	  and melancholy New Zealand film about an eventful summer in a 13-year-old girl 's life . 	joy	moviereview
28105	6430_1	  Tiresomely derivative 	disgust	moviereview

13027	6431_2	 We never truly come to care about the main characters and whether or not 	disgust	moviereview
13028	6431_3	 , and Michele 's spiritual quest is neither amusing nor dramatic enough to sustain interest .  	disgust	moviereview
28107	6432_1	  The plot grows thin soon , 	disgust	moviereview
28108	6432_2	  and you find yourself praying for a quick resolution . 	disgust	moviereview
4109	6433_1	Too bad Maggio could n't come up with a better script .	disgust	moviereview
1716	6434_1	Much of the cast is stiff or just plain bad .	disgust	moviereview
13029	6435_1	 that would set it apart from other Deep South stories  	noemotion	moviereview
13030	6435_2	 Rice is too pedestrian a filmmaker to bring any edge or personality to The Rising Place 	disgust	moviereview
1717	6436_1	At best , Cletis Tout might inspire a trip to the video store -- in search of a better movie experience .	disgust	moviereview
1718	6437_1	Witless , pointless , tasteless and idiotic .	disgust	moviereview
4110	6438_1	Not really a thriller so much as a movie for teens to laugh , groan and hiss at .	disgust	moviereview
28109	6439_1	  As plain 	disgust	moviereview
28110	6439_2	  and pedestrian as catsup -- 	disgust	moviereview
25603	643_1	  Cute , funny , heartwarming digitally animated feature film with plenty of slapstick humor for the kids , lots of in-jokes for the adults 	joy	moviereview
25604	643_2	  and heart enough for everyone . 	joy	moviereview

13032	6440_2	 An improvement on the feeble examples of big-screen Poke-mania 	disgust	moviereview
13033	6441_1	 that Undercover Brother missed an opportunity to strongly present some profound social commentary  	disgust	moviereview
13034	6441_2	 I know we 're not supposed to take it seriously  	disgust	moviereview
13035	6441_4	 , but I ca n't shake the thought 	noemotion	moviereview
1719	6442_1	Your stomach for Heaven depends largely on your appetite for canned corn .	disgust	moviereview
1720	6443_1	A picture as erratic as its central character .	disgust	moviereview
13036	6444_1	 Whatever satire Lucky Break was aiming for  	noemotion	moviereview
13037	6444_2	 , it certainly got lost in the `` soon-to-be-forgettable '' section of the quirky rip-off prison romp pile .  	disgust	moviereview
13038	6445_1	 that puts flimsy flicks like this behind bars  	disgust	moviereview
13039	6445_2	 It 's petty thievery like this 	noemotion	moviereview
13040	6446_1	 in which this fascinating -- and timely -- content comes wrapped  	joy	moviereview
13041	6446_2	 The package 	noemotion	moviereview

13044	6448_2	 Some of the characters die and others do n't , and the film pretends 	noemotion	moviereview
23651	6449_1	  Wildly incompetent 	disgust	moviereview
23652	6449_2	  but brilliantly named Half Past Dead -- or for Seagal pessimists : Totally Past His Prime . 	disgust	moviereview
88	644_1	very solid , very watchable first feature for director Peter Sheridan	joy	moviereview
28113	6450_1	  Just another combination of bad animation 	disgust	moviereview
28114	6450_2	  and mindless violence ... lacking the slightest bit of wit or charm . 	disgust	moviereview
13045	6451_1	 and that its story just is n't worth telling  	disgust	moviereview
13046	6451_2	 that it 's inauthentic at its core  	disgust	moviereview
13047	6451_3	 All the movie 's narrative gymnastics ca n't disguise the fact 	noemotion	moviereview
4111	6452_1	Much like its easily dismissive take on the upscale lifestyle , there is n't much there here .	disgust	moviereview
4112	6453_1	The film ultimately offers nothing more than people in an urban jungle needing other people to survive ...	disgust	moviereview
13048	6454_1	 bore , so tedious it makes the silly spy vs. spy film The Sum of All Fears , starring Ben Affleck , seem downright Hitchcockian  	disgust	moviereview
13049	6454_2	 For all its shoot-outs , fistfights , and car chases  	noemotion	moviereview
13050	6454_4	 , this movie is a phlegmatic 	disgust	moviereview
13051	6455_1	 that bespeaks an expiration date passed a long time ago  	disgust	moviereview
13052	6455_2	 This mild-mannered farce , directed by one of its writers , John C. Walsh , is corny in a way 	disgust	moviereview
1721	6456_1	A bit too eager to please .	disgust	moviereview
1722	6457_1	You 'd be hard put to find a movie character more unattractive or odorous -LRB- than Leon -RRB- .	disgust	moviereview
13053	6458_1	 that works against itself  	disgust	moviereview
13054	6458_2	 Kapur 's contradictory feelings about his material result in a movie 	disgust	moviereview

28117	6464_1	  Jacobi , the most fluent of actors , is given relatively dry material from Nijinsky 's writings to perform , 	disgust	moviereview
28118	6464_2	  and the visuals , even erotically frank ones , become dullingly repetitive . 	disgust	moviereview
15707	6465_1	 that holds interest in the midst of a mushy , existential exploration of why men leave their families  	joy	moviereview

15816	6467_2	 Despite terrific special effects and funnier gags , Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets finds 	disgust	moviereview
1725	6468_1	An incredibly narrow in-joke targeted to the tiniest segment of an already obscure demographic .	disgust	moviereview
15836	6469_1	 I laughed at  	joy	moviereview
15859	6469_2	 who paid to see it  	disgust	moviereview

7393	646_1	 that is done by the supposedly liberal media ... to the intimate and ultimately tragic heartache of maverick individuals like Hatfield and Hicks  	sadness	moviereview
7394	646_2	 It suggests the wide-ranging effects of media manipulation , from the kind of reporting 	disgust	moviereview
23653	6470_1	  All of the elements are in place for a great film noir , 	joy	moviereview
23654	6470_2	  but director George Hickenlooper 's approach to the material is too upbeat . 	disgust	moviereview

15945	6471_2	 The hackneyed story about an affluent damsel in distress 	disgust	moviereview

4113	6474_1	O.K. , not really .	noemotion	moviereview
1726	6475_1	Possibly the most irresponsible picture ever released by a major film studio .	disgust	moviereview
24806	6476_1	  The film 's overall mood 	disgust	moviereview
24807	6476_2	  and focus is interesting 	joy	moviereview
24808	6476_3	  but constantly unfulfilling . 	disgust	moviereview
1727	6477_1	... a cheap , ludicrous attempt at serious horror .	disgust	moviereview

16202	6481_2	 The movie would seem less of a trifle 	disgust	moviereview

16222	6483_1	 with any viewer forced to watch him try out so many complicated facial expressions  	disgust	moviereview
16239	6483_2	 Like the excruciating End of Days , Collateral Damage presents Schwarzenegger as a tragic figure , but sympathy really belongs 	disgust	moviereview
28119	6484_1	  Imagine -LRB- if possible -RRB- a Pasolini film without passion or politics , or an Almodovar movie without beauty or humor , 	disgust	moviereview

28121	6485_1	  In trying to be daring 	disgust	moviereview
28122	6485_2	  and original , it comes off as only occasionally satirical 	disgust	moviereview

28124	6486_1	  90 punitive minutes of eardrum-dicing gunplay , screeching-metal smashups , 	disgust	moviereview
28125	6486_2	  and flaccid odd-couple sniping . 	disgust	moviereview
16260	6487_1	 Sadly , though many of the actors throw off a spark or two when they first appear  	disgust	moviereview
16304	6487_3	 , they ca n't generate enough heat in this cold vacuum of a comedy to start a reaction .  	disgust	moviereview
28126	6488_1	  Never capitalizes on this concept 	disgust	moviereview
28127	6488_2	  and opts for the breezy 	noemotion	moviereview
28128	6488_3	  and amateurish feel of an after school special on the subject of tolerance . 	disgust	moviereview
16324	6489_1	 that seem so real in small doses  	disgust	moviereview
16346	6489_2	 After a while , Hoffman 's quirks and mannerisms , particularly his penchant for tearing up on cue -- things 	disgust	moviereview
16368	6489_3	 -- become annoying and artificial .  	disgust	moviereview
7397	648_1	 should have found a summer place  	disgust	moviereview

16410	6490_2	 This wretchedly unfunny wannabe comedy is inane and awful - no doubt , it 's the worst movie 	disgust	moviereview

1730	6492_1	It 's uninteresting .	disgust	moviereview
1731	6493_1	It squanders Chan 's uniqueness ; it could even be said to squander Jennifer Love Hewitt !	disgust	moviereview
28129	6494_1	  The movie keeps coming back to the achingly unfunny Phonce 	disgust	moviereview
28130	6494_2	  and his several silly subplots . 	disgust	moviereview
24809	6495_1	  This tale has been told 	noemotion	moviereview
24810	6495_2	  and retold ; the races 	disgust	moviereview
24811	6495_3	  and rackets change , 	disgust	moviereview
24812	6495_4	  but the song remains the same . 	disgust	moviereview
28131	6496_1	  A surprisingly flat retread , hobbled by half-baked setups 	disgust	moviereview
28132	6496_2	  and sluggish pacing . 	disgust	moviereview
28133	6497_1	  Forget the Psychology 101 study of romantic obsession 	disgust	moviereview
28134	6497_2	  and just watch the procession of costumes in castles 	joy	moviereview
28135	6497_3	  and this wo n't seem like such a bore . 	disgust	moviereview
16432	6498_1	 that should be relegated to a dark video store corner  	disgust	moviereview
16454	6498_2	 A film 	disgust	moviereview

16498	6499_1	 that could be any flatter  	disgust	moviereview

3631	649_1	Branagh , in his most forceful non-Shakespeare screen performance , grounds even the softest moments in the angry revolt of his wit .	joy	moviereview
11	64_1	Yet the act is still charming here .	joy	moviereview
16543	6500_1	 exactly how bad it is  	disgust	moviereview
16566	6500_2	 New ways of describing badness need to be invented to describe 	disgust	moviereview
24813	6501_1	  Lots of effort 	disgust	moviereview
24814	6501_2	  and intelligence are on display 	disgust	moviereview
24815	6501_3	  but in execution it is all awkward , static , 	disgust	moviereview
24816	6501_4	  and lifeless rumblings . 	disgust	moviereview
16588	6502_1	 When cowering and begging at the feet a scruffy Giannini  	joy	moviereview
16611	6502_2	 since Abel Ferrara had her beaten to a pulp in his Dangerous Game  	disgust	moviereview
16633	6502_3	 , Madonna gives her best performance 	joy	moviereview
16655	6503_1	 that there are more interesting ways of dealing with the subject  	disgust	moviereview
16676	6503_2	 I suspect 	disgust	moviereview
16699	6504_1	 that would probably work better as a real documentary without the insinuation of mediocre acting or a fairly trite narrative  	disgust	moviereview
16722	6504_2	 The film itself is about something very interesting and odd 	disgust	moviereview
4115	6505_1	An unintentional parody of every teen movie made in the last five years .	joy	moviereview
16744	6506_1	 if them  	disgust	moviereview

28137	6507_2	  and put pillowcases over their heads for 87 minutes . 	disgust	moviereview
1732	6508_1	For all its violence , the movie is remarkably dull with only Caine making much of an impression .	disgust	moviereview
16787	6509_1	 No matter how firmly director John Stainton has his tongue in his cheek  	disgust	moviereview
16808	6509_2	 that a wacky concept does not a movie make  	disgust	moviereview
16849	6509_4	 , the fact remains 	disgust	moviereview
7399	650_1	 Though the violence is far less sadistic than usual  	disgust	moviereview
7400	650_2	 the film is typical Miike : fast , furious and full of off-the-cuff imaginative flourishes . 	joy	moviereview
1733	6510_1	A sub-formulaic slap in the face to seasonal cheer .	disgust	moviereview
28138	6511_1	  The action is reasonably well-done ... yet story , character 	disgust	moviereview

13880	6622_2	 , the characters respond by hitting on each other .  	noemotion	moviereview
28183	6623_1	  Britney Spears ' phoniness is nothing compared to the movie 's contrived , lame screenplay 	disgust	moviereview
28184	6623_2	  and listless direction . 	disgust	moviereview
13943	6624_3	 Every sequel you skip 	noemotion	moviereview
13964	6624_4	 will be two hours gained 	noemotion	moviereview
905	6625_1	Consider this review life-affirming .	joy	moviereview
13986	6626_1	 If the movie were all comedy  	disgust	moviereview
14008	6626_2	 , it might work better .  	disgust	moviereview
23671	6627_1	  But it has an ambition to say something about its subjects , 	disgust	moviereview
23672	6627_2	  but not a willingness . 	disgust	moviereview
14031	6628_1	 labored , with a hint of the writing exercise about it  	disgust	moviereview
14052	6628_2	 The movie , while beautiful , feels 	disgust	moviereview
1755	6629_1	Twenty-three movies into a mostly magnificent directorial career , Clint Eastwood 's efficiently minimalist style finally has failed him .	disgust	moviereview
25605	662_1	  Ice Cube holds the film together with an engaging 	joy	moviereview
25606	662_2	  and warm performance ... 	joy	moviereview
2859	6630_1	Big time .	noemotion	moviereview
28185	6631_1	  This heist flick about young Brooklyn hoods is off the shelf after two years to capitalize on the popularity of Vin Diesel , Seth Green 	joy	moviereview
28186	6631_2	  and Barry Pepper . 	noemotion	moviereview
2860	6632_1	It should have stayed there .	noemotion	moviereview
4125	6633_1	The film has a childlike quality about it .	joy	moviereview
8411	6634_1	But the feelings evoked in the film are lukewarm and quick to pass .	disgust	moviereview
14073	6635_1	 as you can imagine  	disgust	moviereview
14094	6635_2	 The most opaque , self-indulgent and just plain goofy an excuse for a movie 	disgust	moviereview
23673	6636_1	  It 's not a film to be taken literally on any level , 	disgust	moviereview
23674	6636_2	  but its focus always appears questionable . 	disgust	moviereview
14117	6637_1	 than Home Alone raised to a new , self-deprecating level  	disgust	moviereview
14140	6637_2	 Big Fat Liar is little more 	disgust	moviereview
24823	6638_1	  The movie is gorgeously made , 	joy	moviereview
24824	6638_2	  but it is also somewhat shallow 	disgust	moviereview
24825	6638_3	  and art-conscious . 	disgust	moviereview
14162	6639_1	 8 Crazy Nights comes close to hitting a comedic or satirical target  	disgust	moviereview
14184	6639_2	 The only time 	noemotion	moviereview
14204	6639_3	 is during the offbeat musical numbers .  	disgust	moviereview
25607	663_1	  Both deeply weird 	disgust	moviereview
25608	663_2	  and charmingly dear . 	joy	moviereview
28187	6640_1	  Loses its sense of humor in a vat of failed jokes , twitchy acting , 	disgust	moviereview
28188	6640_2	  and general boorishness . 	disgust	moviereview
23675	6641_1	  There 's a delightfully quirky movie to be made from curling , 	disgust	moviereview
23676	6641_2	  but Brooms is n't it . 	disgust	moviereview
1756	6642_1	The story suffers a severe case of oversimplification , superficiality and silliness .	disgust	moviereview
906	6643_1	Chamber of Secrets will find millions of eager fans .	joy	moviereview
14226	6644_1	 But if the essence of magic is its make-believe promise of life that soars above the material realm  	joy	moviereview
14270	6644_3	 , this is the opposite of a truly magical movie .  	disgust	moviereview
907	6645_1	Too clever by about nine-tenths .	disgust	moviereview
14291	6646_1	 it absorbs all manner of lame entertainment  	disgust	moviereview
14312	6646_2	 as long as 3-year-olds find it diverting  	disgust	moviereview
14334	6646_3	 Has all the hallmarks of a movie designed strictly for children 's home video , a market so insatiable 	disgust	moviereview
1757	6647_1	Bears about as much resemblance to the experiences of most battered women as Spider-Man does to the experiences of most teenagers .	disgust	moviereview
1758	6648_1	Toward the end Sum of All Fears morphs into a mundane '70s disaster flick .	disgust	moviereview
28189	6649_1	  Director Carl Franklin , so crisp 	disgust	moviereview
28190	6649_2	  and economical in One False Move , bogs down in genre cliches here . 	disgust	moviereview
7414	664_1	 lends its conflicts a symbolic resonance  	joy	moviereview
7415	664_2	 As blunt as it is in depicting child abuse , El Bola is a movie steeped in an ambiguity that 	disgust	moviereview
14378	6650_1	 how to fill a frame  	disgust	moviereview
14398	6650_2	 Mendes still does n't quite know 	noemotion	moviereview
28191	6651_1	  Like the Hanks character , he 's a slow study : The action is stilted 	disgust	moviereview
28192	6651_2	  and the tabloid energy embalmed . 	disgust	moviereview
1759	6652_1	This thing is just garbage .	disgust	moviereview

14442	6653_2	 As crimes go  	noemotion	moviereview
14465	6653_3	 , writer-director Michael Kalesniko 's 	disgust	moviereview
14487	6653_4	 is slight but unendurable .  	disgust	moviereview
14509	6654_1	 that enjoys the Friday series  	disgust	moviereview
14529	6654_2	 There must be an audience 	disgust	moviereview
14550	6654_3	 , but I would n't be interested in knowing any of them personally .  	disgust	moviereview
14591	6655_2	 A bold -LRB- and lovely -RRB- experiment 	joy	moviereview
14612	6655_3	 that will almost certainly bore most audiences into their own brightly colored dreams .  	disgust	moviereview
4126	6656_1	An uplifting , largely bogus story .	joy	moviereview
23677	6657_1	  An empty exercise , a florid 	disgust	moviereview
23678	6657_2	  but ultimately vapid crime melodrama with lots of surface flash 	disgust	moviereview
23679	6657_3	  but little emotional resonance . 	disgust	moviereview
14634	6658_1	 If you are curious to see the darker side of what 's going on with young TV actors -LRB- Dawson Leery did what ?!? -RRB-  	surprise	moviereview
14656	6658_2	 , or see some interesting storytelling devices , you might want to check it out , but there 's nothing very attractive about this movie .  	disgust	moviereview
14679	6659_1	 that it stinks  	disgust	moviereview
14700	6659_2	 My own minority report is 	disgust	moviereview
7416	665_1	 to make The Sound of Music play like a nail-biting thriller  	joy	moviereview
7417	665_2	 Despite a story predictable enough 	disgust	moviereview
7418	665_3	 its heart is so much in the right place  	joy	moviereview
8253	665_4	 it is difficult to get really peeved at it . 	joy	moviereview
28193	6660_1	  Trying to make head or tail of the story in the hip-hop indie Snipes is enough to give you brain strain -- 	disgust	moviereview
28194	6660_2	  and the pay-off is negligible . 	disgust	moviereview
2861	6661_1	The script is high on squaddie banter , low on shocks .	disgust	moviereview
14721	6662_1	 if you , like me , think an action film disguised as a war tribute is disgusting to begin with  	disgust	moviereview
14763	6662_3	 , then you 're in for a painful ride .  	disgust	moviereview
14785	6663_1	 While Solondz tries and tries hard  	disgust	moviereview
14807	6663_2	 , Storytelling fails to provide much more insight than the inside column of a torn book jacket .  	disgust	moviereview
28195	6664_1	  With very little to add beyond the dark visions already relayed by superb recent predecessors like Swimming With Sharks 	disgust	moviereview
28196	6664_2	  and The Player , this latest skewering ... may put off insiders 	disgust	moviereview
28197	6664_3	  and outsiders alike . 	disgust	moviereview
14828	6665_1	 he refuses to give us real situations and characters  	disgust	moviereview
14848	6665_2	 -LRB- Davis -RRB- wants to cause his audience an epiphany , yet 	disgust	moviereview
1760	6666_1	Without a fresh infusion of creativity , 4Ever is neither a promise nor a threat so much as wishful thinking .	disgust	moviereview
1761	6667_1	... unlike -LRB- Scorsese 's Mean Streets -RRB- , Ash Wednesday is essentially devoid of interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot .	disgust	moviereview
14870	6668_1	 no matter how admirably the filmmakers have gone for  broke 	disgust	moviereview
14889	6668_2	 does n't necessarily equate to being good  	disgust	moviereview
14912	6668_3	 Being unique 	noemotion	moviereview
14971	6669_1	 you 've been to the movies  	noemotion	moviereview
14991	6669_2	 A few hours after you 've seen it  	disgust	moviereview
15013	6669_3	 , you forget 	disgust	moviereview
25609	666_1	  An incredibly low-rent Danish film , it brings a group of people together in a sweet 	joy	moviereview
25610	666_2	  and charming way , if a little convenient 	joy	moviereview
23680	6670_1	  waydowntown may not be an important movie , or even a good one , 	disgust	moviereview
23681	6670_2	  but it provides a nice change of mindless pace in collision with the hot Oscar season currently underway . 	joy	moviereview
15032	6671_1	 it 's lovely that Cal works out his issues with his dad and comes to terms with his picture-perfect life  	joy	moviereview
15053	6671_2	 Yes , I suppose 	disgust	moviereview
15073	6671_3	 -- but World Traveler gave me no reason to care , so I did n't .  	disgust	moviereview
15093	6672_1	 Shadyac , who belongs with the damned for perpetrating Patch Adams  	disgust	moviereview
15131	6672_3	 , trots out every ghost trick from The Sixth Sense to The Mothman Prophecies .  	disgust	moviereview
23682	6673_1	  The photographer 's show-don ` t-tell stance is admirable , 	joy	moviereview
23683	6673_2	  but it can make him a problematic documentary subject . 	disgust	moviereview
15150	6674_1	 that director Sara Sugarman stoops to having characters drop their pants for laughs and not the last time  	disgust	moviereview
15169	6674_2	 It is not the first time 	disgust	moviereview
15189	6674_3	 she fails to provoke them .  	disgust	moviereview
1762	6675_1	I 'd be hard pressed to think of a film more cloyingly sappy than Evelyn this year .	disgust	moviereview
15210	6676_1	 that plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises  	disgust	moviereview
15230	6676_2	 Nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle 	disgust	moviereview
4127	6677_1	meanders between its powerful moments .	disgust	moviereview
15252	6678_1	 What remains  	disgust	moviereview
15274	6678_2	 is a variant of the nincompoop Benigni persona , here a more annoying , though less angry version of the irresponsible Sandlerian manchild , undercut by the voice of the star of Road Trip .  	disgust	moviereview
15294	6679_1	 who has little clue about either the nature of women or of friendship  	disgust	moviereview
15315	6679_2	 A backhanded ode to female camaraderie penned by a man 	disgust	moviereview
7419	667_1	 it 's nonsense  	disgust	moviereview
7420	667_2	 It 's the cinematic equivalent of a good page-turner , and even if 	joy	moviereview
8254	667_3	 its claws dig surprisingly deep .	joy	moviereview
28198	6680_1	  Pure of intention 	disgust	moviereview
28199	6680_2	  and passably diverting , His Secret Life is light , innocuous and unremarkable .	disgust	moviereview
28200	6681_1	  ... delivers few moments of inspiration amid the bland animation 	disgust	moviereview
28201	6681_2	  and simplistic story . 	disgust	moviereview
28202	6682_1	  Take away the controversy , 	joy	moviereview
28203	6682_2	  and it 's not much more watchable than a Mexican soap opera . 	disgust	moviereview
23684	6683_1	  It 's got the brawn , 	joy	moviereview
23685	6683_2	  but not the brains . 	disgust	moviereview
28204	6684_2	 Mindless and boring martial arts 	disgust	moviereview
28205	6684_3	  and gunplay with too little excitement 	disgust	moviereview
28206	6684_4	  and zero compelling storyline . 	disgust	moviereview
1763	6685_1	A lot of talent is wasted in this crass , low-wattage endeavor .	disgust	moviereview
28207	6686_1	  To show these characters in the act 	disgust	moviereview
28208	6686_2	  and give them no feelings of remorse -- 	sadness	moviereview
28209	6686_3	  and to cut repeatedly to the flashback of the original rape -- is overkill to the highest degree . 	disgust	moviereview
1764	6687_1	-LRB- T -RRB- oo many of these gross out scenes ...	disgust	moviereview
1765	6688_1	About one in three gags in White 's intermittently wise script hits its mark ; the rest are padding unashamedly appropriated from the teen-exploitation playbook .	disgust	moviereview
15336	6689_1	 which ones shtick  	noemotion	moviereview
15355	6689_2	 Little is done to support the premise other than fling gags at it to see 	disgust	moviereview
3634	668_1	Director Nalin Pan does n't do much to weigh any arguments one way or the other .	noemotion	moviereview
15376	6690_1	 what he can in a thankless situation  	joy	moviereview

15418	6690_3	 Reno does 	joy	moviereview
15440	6690_4	 , the film ricochets from humor to violence and back again , and Ryoko Hirosue makes us wonder 	disgust	moviereview
15460	6691_1	 If Jews were Catholics  	noemotion	moviereview
15482	6691_2	 , this would be Catechism  	noemotion	moviereview
15503	6692_1	 when one has nothing else to watch  	disgust	moviereview
15524	6692_2	 that seems tailor  	disgust	moviereview
15544	6692_3	 One of those films 	noemotion	moviereview

4128	6693_1	The big ending surprise almost saves the movie .	disgust	moviereview

15665	6695_3	 ...  	joy	moviereview
28210	6696_1	  Schneider 's mugging is relentless 	disgust	moviereview

24827	6697_2	  and beautifully photographed , 	disgust	moviereview

24829	6697_4	  and actors playing more than one role just to add to the confusion . 	disgust	moviereview
1766	6698_1	It 's probably not easy to make such a worthless film ...	disgust	moviereview
15686	6699_1	 that the movie will live up to the apparent skills of its makers and the talents of its actors  	disgust	moviereview

1770	6708_1	In the era of The Sopranos , it feels painfully redundant and inauthentic .	disgust	moviereview
28214	6709_1	  The overall vibe is druggy 	disgust	moviereview

2742	670_1	No question .	noemotion	moviereview
1771	6710_1	Breen 's script is sketchy with actorish notations on the margin of acting .	disgust	moviereview

16119	6714_1	 to be as naturally charming as it needs to be  	disgust	moviereview
16140	6714_2	 ... too contrived 	disgust	moviereview
4129	6715_1	A simpler , leaner treatment would have been preferable ; after all , being about nothing is sometimes funnier than being about something .	disgust	moviereview
28218	6716_1	  The characters are based on stock clichs , 	disgust	moviereview

16544	6730_3	 may fall fast asleep .  	disgust	moviereview
16567	6731_1	 that feels dusty and leatherbound  	disgust	moviereview

16677	6733_2	 do n't bother .  	disgust	moviereview
28222	6734_1	  Full Frontal had no effect 	disgust	moviereview
28223	6734_2	  and elicited no sympathies for any of the characters . 	disgust	moviereview
1776	6735_1	By that measure , it is a failure .	disgust	moviereview
28224	6736_1	  A baffling mixed platter of gritty realism 	surprise	moviereview
28225	6736_2	  and magic realism with a hard-to-swallow premise . 	disgust	moviereview
16700	6737_1	 that fails to match the freshness of the actress-producer and writer 's previous collaboration , Miss Congeniality  	disgust	moviereview
16723	6737_2	 An affable but undernourished romantic comedy 	disgust	moviereview
28226	6738_1	  Sometimes this modest little number clicks , 	joy	moviereview
28227	6738_2	  and sometimes it does n't . 	disgust	moviereview
4131	6739_1	Like a pack of dynamite sticks , built for controversy .	noemotion	moviereview
7425	673_1	 What Full Frontal lacks in thematic coherence  	disgust	moviereview
7426	673_2	 it largely makes up for as loosey-goosey , experimental entertainment . 	joy	moviereview
23686	6740_1	  The film is explosive , 	disgust	moviereview
23687	6740_2	  but a few of those sticks are wet . 	joy	moviereview
28228	6741_1	  Has its charming quirks 	joy	moviereview

16766	6742_2	 An admitted egomaniac , Evans is no Hollywood villain , and yet this grating showcase almost makes 	disgust	moviereview
16788	6743_1	 when they 're supposed to be having a collective heart attack  	disgust	moviereview
16809	6743_2	 when I saw this one  	noemotion	moviereview
16829	6743_3	 The audience 	noemotion	moviereview
16850	6743_4	 was chuckling at all the wrong times , and that 's a bad sign 	disgust	moviereview
16873	6744_1	 Everyone's to blame here  	disgust	moviereview
16913	6745_1	 that writer and director Burr Steers knows the territory  	disgust	moviereview
16933	6745_2	 You get the impression 	disgust	moviereview
16953	6745_3	 ... but his sense of humor has yet to lose the smug self-satisfaction usually associated with the better private schools .  	disgust	moviereview
2862	6746_1	Less a study in madness or love than a study in schoolgirl obsession .	disgust	moviereview
1777	6747_1	Rice never clearly defines his characters or gives us a reason to care about them .	disgust	moviereview
16974	6748_1	 it fritters away its potentially interesting subject matter via a banal script , unimpressive acting and indifferent direction  	disgust	moviereview
16996	6748_2	 It 's a bizarre curiosity memorable mainly for the way 	joy	moviereview
17017	6749_1	 whose target demographic is likely still in the single digits , age-wise  	noemotion	moviereview
17038	6749_2	 A slight and obvious effort , even for one 	disgust	moviereview

17103	6751_3	 all is a moral .  	noemotion	moviereview
4132	6752_1	What is the filmmakers ' point ?	noemotion	moviereview
1778	6753_1	Why did they deem it necessary to document all this emotional misery ?	disgust	moviereview
28230	6754_1	  You see Robin Williams 	surprise	moviereview

17126	6756_1	 that reek of a script  	disgust	moviereview
17148	6756_2	 Downright transparent is the script 's endless assault of embarrassingly ham-fisted sex jokes 	disgust	moviereview
17170	6756_3	 rewrite designed to garner the film a `` cooler '' PG-13 rating .  	disgust	moviereview
1779	6757_1	The movie slides downhill as soon as macho action conventions assert themselves .	disgust	moviereview
4133	6758_1	Formulaic to the 51st power , more like .	joy	moviereview

25615	675_3	  and refreshingly unusual . 	joy	moviereview
24833	6760_1	  Howard 	disgust	moviereview
24834	6760_2	  and his co-stars all give committed performances , 	joy	moviereview
24835	6760_3	  but they 're often undone by Howard 's self-conscious attempts to find a ` literary ' filmmaking style to match his subject . 	disgust	moviereview
17193	6761_1	 that 's intelligent and considered in its details , but ultimately weak in its impact  	joy	moviereview
17215	6761_2	 A respectable but uninspired thriller 	disgust	moviereview
23688	6762_1	  Jones helps breathe some life into the insubstantial plot , 	disgust	moviereview
23689	6762_2	  but even he is overwhelmed by predictability . 	disgust	moviereview
4134	6763_1	The movie just has too much on its plate to really stay afloat for its just under ninety minute running time .	disgust	moviereview
17236	6764_1	 that never catches fire  	disgust	moviereview
17259	6764_2	 Comes off more like a misdemeanor , a flat , unconvincing drama 	disgust	moviereview
1374	6765_1	Offers absolutely nothing I had n't already seen .	disgust	moviereview
17280	6766_1	 that not only fails on its own , but makes you second-guess your affection for the original  	disgust	moviereview
17300	6766_2	 `` Analyze That '' is one of those crass , contrived sequels 	disgust	moviereview
17321	6767_1	 Tykwer has done all that Heaven allows , if you wanted to make as anti-Kieslowski a pun as possible  	joy	moviereview
17341	6767_2	 You might say 	disgust	moviereview
17364	6768_1	 Suffice to say its total promise  	disgust	moviereview
17408	6768_3	 is left slightly unfulfilled .  	disgust	moviereview
28235	6769_1	  Complex , sinuously plotted 	disgust	moviereview

7430	676_2	 -LRB- A -RRB- Hollywood sheen bedevils the film from the very beginning ... -LRB- but -RRB- Lohman 's moist , deeply emotional eyes 	disgust	moviereview
28237	6770_1	  First-time writer-director Dylan Kidd also has a good ear for dialogue , 	joy	moviereview
28238	6770_2	  and the characters sound like real people . 	joy	moviereview
17430	6771_1	 that stinks so badly of hard-sell image-mongering you 'll wonder 	disgust	moviereview
17452	6771_2	 if Lopez 's publicist should share screenwriting credit  	disgust	moviereview
17474	6771_3	 ... an airless , prepackaged Julia Roberts wannabe 	disgust	moviereview
17513	6772_1	 as though Jay Roach directed the film from the back of a taxicab  	disgust	moviereview
17534	6772_2	 Goldmember has none of the visual wit of the previous pictures , and it looks 	disgust	moviereview
17551	6773_1	 that never springs to life  	disgust	moviereview
17573	6773_2	 Could as easily have been called ` Under Siege 3 : In Alcatraz ' ... a cinematic corpse 	disgust	moviereview
1780	6774_1	In comparison to his earlier films it seems a disappointingly thin slice of lower-class London life ; despite the title ... amounts to surprisingly little .	disgust	moviereview
1781	6775_1	Lame Sweet Home leaves no Southern stereotype unturned .	disgust	moviereview
23690	6776_1	  Slow , dry , poorly cast , 	disgust	moviereview
23691	6776_2	  but beautifully shot . 	joy	moviereview
28239	6777_1	  The jokes are sophomoric , stereotypes are sprinkled everywhere 	disgust	moviereview
28240	6777_2	  and the acting ranges from bad to bodacious . 	disgust	moviereview
28241	6778_1	  Will give many ministers 	joy	moviereview
28242	6778_2	  and Bible-study groups hours of material to discuss . 	noemotion	moviereview
17594	6779_1	 which is often preachy and poorly acted  	disgust	moviereview
17615	6779_2	 But mainstream audiences will find little of interest in this film , 	disgust	moviereview
7431	677_1	 a romantic relationship between a 15-year-old boy and a 40-year-old woman does n't work  	noemotion	moviereview
7432	677_2	 Do we really need a 77-minute film to tell us exactly why 	disgust	moviereview
17637	6780_1	 it raises  	disgust	moviereview
17658	6780_2	 In its chicken heart , Crush goes to absurd lengths to duck the very issues 	disgust	moviereview
28243	6781_1	  This long 	disgust	moviereview
28244	6781_2	  and relentlessly saccharine film is a clear case of preaching to the converted . 	disgust	moviereview
1782	6782_1	The film is flat .	disgust	moviereview
23692	6783_1	  The movie is a lumbering load of hokum 	joy	moviereview
23693	6783_2	  but ... it 's at least watchable . 	joy	moviereview
17680	6784_1	 that might have been titled ` The Loud and the Ludicrous '  	disgust	moviereview
17703	6784_2	 It 's a boom-box of a movie 	disgust	moviereview
17725	6784_3	 ... the pandering to a moviegoing audience dominated by young males is all too calculated .  	disgust	moviereview
17745	6785_1	 to make you forget its absurdity  	disgust	moviereview
17765	6785_2	 An unbelievably stupid film , though occasionally fun enough 	disgust	moviereview
1783	6786_1	The first Fatal Attraction was vile enough .	disgust	moviereview
17788	6787_1	 Do we really need the Tiger Beat version  	disgust	moviereview
4135	6788_1	This Bond film goes off the beaten path , not necessarily for the better .	disgust	moviereview
17830	6789_1	 that the movie has no idea of it is serious or not  	disgust	moviereview
17849	6789_2	 The problem is 	disgust	moviereview
90	678_1	Ford deserves to be remembered at Oscar time for crafting this wonderful portrait of a conflicted soldier .	joy	moviereview

23694	6792_1	  The elements were all there 	disgust	moviereview
23695	6792_2	  but lack of a pyschological center knocks it flat . 	disgust	moviereview
28245	6793_1	  Anemic chronicle of money grubbing New Yorkers 	disgust	moviereview
28246	6793_2	  and their serial loveless hook ups . 	disgust	moviereview
1375	6794_1	Simply does n't have sufficient heft to justify its two-hour running time .	disgust	moviereview
1784	6795_1	An unsuccessful attempt at a movie of ideas .	disgust	moviereview
17935	6796_1	 that explode into flame  	noemotion	moviereview

2864	6799_1	Oh , and Booty Call .	noemotion	moviereview
7433	679_1	 viewers may be more exhausted than the athletes onscreen  	disgust	moviereview

3570	67_1	This is the best American movie about troubled teens since 1998 's Whatever .	joy	moviereview
18061	6800_1	 we need Hollywood doing to us  	disgust	moviereview
18084	6800_2	 manipulative and as bland as Wonder Bread dipped in milk  	disgust	moviereview
18106	6800_3	 Not only is it hokey , 	disgust	moviereview
18129	6800_4	 , but it also does the absolute last thing 	noemotion	moviereview
18148	6800_5	 : It preaches .  	disgust	moviereview
18170	6801_1	 that it 's left a few crucial things out  	disgust	moviereview
18193	6801_2	 It 's so crammed with scenes and vistas and pretty moments 	disgust	moviereview

18237	6802_1	 Serving Sara should be served an eviction notice at every theater  	disgust	moviereview
18277	6802_3	 stuck with it .  	disgust	moviereview
18299	6803_1	 that it 's difficult not to cuss him out severely for bungling the big stuff  	disgust	moviereview
18321	6803_2	 Director Roger Michell does so many of the little things right 	joy	moviereview
18342	6804_1	 that arrives cloaked in the euphemism ` urban drama  	noemotion	moviereview
18362	6804_2	 A loud , low-budget and tired formula film 	disgust	moviereview
28247	6805_1	  The movie has a script -LRB- by Paul Pender -RRB- made of wood , 	disgust	moviereview
28248	6805_2	  and it 's relentlessly folksy , a procession of stagy set pieces stacked with binary oppositions . 	disgust	moviereview
18406	6806_1	 that tries to seem sincere , 	disgust	moviereview
18425	6806_2	 A pathetic exploitation film 	disgust	moviereview
18448	6806_3	 and just seems worse for the effort .  	disgust	moviereview
28249	6807_1	  At some point , all this visual trickery stops being clever 	disgust	moviereview
28250	6807_2	  and devolves into flashy , vaguely silly overkill . 	disgust	moviereview
28251	6808_1	  Despite some charm 	disgust	moviereview
28252	6808_2	  and heart , this quirky soccer import is forgettable 	disgust	moviereview
4137	6809_1	Meyjes 's movie , like Max Rothman 's future , does not work .	disgust	moviereview
1543	680_1	Do n't expect any surprises in this checklist of teamwork cliches ...	disgust	moviereview
18469	6810_1	 What 's needed so badly but what is virtually absent  	disgust	moviereview
18490	6810_2	 here is either a saving dark humor or the feel of poetic tragedy .  	disgust	moviereview
4138	6811_1	Schneidermeister ... Makin ' a fool of himself ... Losin ' his fan base ...	disgust	moviereview
13061	6812_1	 that manages to do virtually everything wrong  	disgust	moviereview
13084	6812_2	 An ambitious , serious film 	joy	moviereview
13106	6812_3	 ; sitting through it is something akin to an act of cinematic penance .  	disgust	moviereview
4139	6813_1	Not once does it come close to being exciting .	disgust	moviereview
13128	6814_1	 that careens from dark satire to cartoonish slapstick , Bartleby  	disgust	moviereview
13151	6814_2	 A Frankenstein mishmash 	disgust	moviereview
13173	6814_3	 performs neither one very well .  	disgust	moviereview
13196	6815_1	 who at times lift the material from its well-meaning clunkiness  	joy	moviereview
13218	6815_2	 It plays like a big-budget , after-school special with a generous cast , 	joy	moviereview
4140	6816_1	There 's something not entirely convincing about The Quiet American .	disgust	moviereview
28253	6817_1	  And that holds true for both the movie 	noemotion	moviereview
28254	6817_2	  and the title character played by Brendan Fraser . 	noemotion	moviereview
13238	6818_1	 that 's hardly any fun to watch and begins to vaporize from your memory minutes after it ends  	disgust	moviereview
13261	6818_2	 One of those strained caper movies 	disgust	moviereview
28255	6819_1	  Needed a little less bling-bling 	disgust	moviereview
28256	6819_2	  and a lot more romance . 	disgust	moviereview
7435	681_1	 his Parisian rebirth is stillborn  	disgust	moviereview
7436	681_2	 As adapted by Kevin Molony from Simon Leys ' novel `` The Death of Napoleon '' 	noemotion	moviereview
7437	681_3	 and directed by Alan Taylor , Napoleon 's journey is interesting 	noemotion	moviereview
13282	6820_1	 I 'm almost recommending it , anyway -- maybe not to everybody , but certainly to people with a curiosity about how a movie can go very right , and then step wrong  	joy	moviereview
13304	6820_2	 The ending does n't work ... but most of the movie works so well 	joy	moviereview
13324	6821_1	 these jokers are supposed to have pulled off four similar kidnappings before  	disgust	moviereview
13346	6821_2	 It 's hard to believe 	disgust	moviereview
13369	6822_1	 what this movie thinks it is about  	surprise	moviereview
13392	6822_2	 I 'm not exactly sure 	disgust	moviereview
13412	6823_1	 whom to spend 110 claustrophobic minutes  	disgust	moviereview
13434	6823_2	 Cal is an unpleasantly shallow and immature character with 	disgust	moviereview
13454	6824_1	 that none of the excellent cast are given air to breathe  	disgust	moviereview
13476	6824_2	 So brisk is Wang 's pacing 	disgust	moviereview
13498	6825_1	 makes a better short story than it does a film  	disgust	moviereview
13519	6825_2	 The bottom line , at least in my opinion , is Imposter 	noemotion	moviereview
23696	6826_1	  Some elements of it really blow the big one , 	disgust	moviereview
23697	6826_2	  but other parts are decent . 	joy	moviereview
13540	6827_1	 the film 's story does not live up to its style  	disgust	moviereview
13562	6827_2	 It is just too bad 	disgust	moviereview
13583	6828_1	 Unless you 're a fanatic , the best advice is  	disgust	moviereview
13605	6828_2	 : ` Scooby ' do n't .  	disgust	moviereview
13626	6829_1	 that is itself endlessly superficial  	disgust	moviereview
13648	6829_2	 A cautionary tale about the folly of superficiality 	disgust	moviereview
23236	682_1	  The movie addresses a hungry need for PG-rated , nonthreatening family movies , 	joy	moviereview
23237	682_2	  but it does n't go too much further . 	disgust	moviereview
4141	6830_1	For single digits kidlets Stuart Little 2 is still a no brainer .	joy	moviereview
13669	6831_1	 If you 're looking to rekindle the magic of the first film  	joy	moviereview
13690	6831_2	 , you 'll need a stronger stomach than us .  	disgust	moviereview
28257	6832_1	  Shreve 's graceful dual narrative gets clunky on the screen , 	disgust	moviereview
28258	6832_2	  and we keep getting torn away from the compelling historical tale to a less-compelling soap opera . 	disgust	moviereview
13711	6833_1	 that graze the funny bone or miss it altogether , in part because the consciously dumbed-down approach wears thin  	disgust	moviereview
13731	6833_2	 Contains a few big laughs but many more 	disgust	moviereview
13749	6834_1	 if stupid Americans will get a kick out of goofy Brits with cute accents performing ages-old slapstick and unfunny tricks  	disgust	moviereview
13772	6834_2	 Nothing more than a widget cranked out on an assembly line to see 	disgust	moviereview
13792	6835_1	 who when they were in high school would choose the Cliff-Notes over reading a full-length classic  	disgust	moviereview
13814	6835_2	 This is a film tailor-made for those 	disgust	moviereview
13836	6836_1	 that 's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads  	disgust	moviereview
13859	6836_2	 The movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology 	disgust	moviereview
13881	6837_1	 that did not figure out a coherent game  	disgust	moviereview
13903	6837_2	 A jumbled fantasy comedy 	disgust	moviereview
13922	6837_3	 plan at scripting , shooting or post-production stages .  	disgust	moviereview
13944	6838_1	 that shockingly manages to be even worse than its title  	disgust	moviereview
13965	6838_2	 A sad and rote exercise in milking a played-out idea -- a straight guy has to dress up in drag -- 	disgust	moviereview
13987	6838_3	 would imply .  	disgust	moviereview
23698	6839_1	  Personal Velocity ought to be exploring these women 's inner lives , 	disgust	moviereview
23699	6839_2	  but it never moves beyond their surfaces . 	disgust	moviereview
7438	683_1	 to fill several movies  	joy	moviereview
7439	683_2	 This warm and gentle romantic comedy has enough interesting characters 	joy	moviereview
8255	683_3	 and its ample charms should win over the most hard-hearted cynics . 	joy	moviereview
28259	6840_1	  We hate -LRB- Madonna -RRB- within the film 's first five minutes , 	disgust	moviereview
28260	6840_2	  and she lacks the skill or presence to regain any ground . 	disgust	moviereview
14009	6841_1	 that does n't produce any real transformation  	disgust	moviereview
14032	6841_2	 Sounding like Arnold Schwarzenegger , with a physique to match , -LRB- Ahola -RRB- has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change 	disgust	moviereview
28261	6842_1	  Two big things are missing -- anything approaching a visceral kick , 	disgust	moviereview
28262	6842_2	  and anything approaching even a vague reason to sit through it all . 	disgust	moviereview
23700	6843_1	  A fascinating 	joy	moviereview
23701	6843_2	  but choppy documentary . 	disgust	moviereview
1786	6844_1	Scarcely worth a mention apart from reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theatres graced with its company .	disgust	moviereview
4142	6845_1	The doofus-on - the-loose banter of Welcome to Collinwood has a cocky , after-hours loopiness to it .	joy	moviereview
14053	6846_1	 as the rowdy participants think it is  	noemotion	moviereview
14074	6846_2	 And as with most late-night bull sessions , eventually the content is n't nearly as captivating 	disgust	moviereview
28263	6847_1	  Too stagey , talky -- 	disgust	moviereview
28264	6847_2	  and long -- for its own good . 	disgust	moviereview
1787	6848_1	Apparently reassembled from the cutting-room floor of any given daytime soap .	disgust	moviereview
14095	6849_1	 that fuelled DeVito 's early work  	noemotion	moviereview
14118	6849_2	 The sinister inspiration 	noemotion	moviereview
14141	6849_3	 is confused in Death to Smoochy into something both ugly and mindless .  	disgust	moviereview
7440	684_1	 A yarn that respects the Marvel version 	joy	moviereview
7441	684_2	 without becoming ensnared by it . 	noemotion	moviereview
14163	6850_1	 where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug  	disgust	moviereview
14185	6850_2	 Despite Auteuil 's performance , it 's a rather listless amble down the middle of the road , 	disgust	moviereview
14205	6851_1	 that was probably more fun to make than it is to sit through  	disgust	moviereview
14227	6851_2	 Director Boris von Sychowski instead opts for a routine slasher film 	disgust	moviereview
1788	6852_1	... little more than a well-acted television melodrama shot for the big screen .	disgust	moviereview
4143	6853_1	Never comes together as a coherent whole .	disgust	moviereview
14249	6854_1	 in which actors in bad bear suits enact a sort of inter-species parody of a VH1 Behind the Music episode  	disgust	moviereview
14271	6854_2	 An unintentionally surreal kid 's picture ... 	disgust	moviereview
14292	6855_1	 that tries to be smart  	disgust	moviereview
14313	6855_2	 First , for a movie 	disgust	moviereview
14335	6855_3	 , it 's kinda dumb .  	disgust	moviereview
14357	6856_1	 what 's with all the shooting  	anger	moviereview
14379	6856_2	 And second , 	noemotion	moviereview
1789	6857_1	Do n't even bother to rent this on video .	disgust	moviereview
14399	6858_1	 how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them  	disgust	moviereview
14422	6858_2	 I guess , about artifice and acting  	noemotion	moviereview
14443	6858_3	 only if you have an interest in the characters you see  	noemotion	moviereview
14466	6858_4	 There is something in Full Frontal , 	joy	moviereview
14510	6858_6	 , but like most movie riddles , it works 	joy	moviereview
14530	6859_1	 that gets a quick release before real contenders arrive in September  	disgust	moviereview
14551	6859_2	 This is the kind of movie 	noemotion	moviereview
7442	685_1	 cartoons were cinema 's most idiosyncratic form instead of one of its most predictable  	joy	moviereview
7443	685_2	 This is a happy throwback to the time when 	joy	moviereview
14570	6860_1	 that made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes  	disgust	moviereview
14592	6860_2	 I 've been trying to forget  	disgust	moviereview
14613	6860_3	 Not counting a few gross-out comedies 	disgust	moviereview
14635	6860_4	 , this is the first film in a long time 	disgust	moviereview
28265	6861_1	  Plays like one long , meandering sketch inspired by the works of John Waters 	disgust	moviereview
28266	6861_2	  and Todd Solondz , rather than a fully developed story . 	disgust	moviereview
14657	6862_1	 that made Spy Kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences  	disgust	moviereview
14680	6862_2	 The film does n't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm 	disgust	moviereview
14701	6863_1	 that plays like some weird Masterpiece Theater sketch with  	disgust	moviereview
14722	6863_2	 A mawkish self-parody 	disgust	moviereview
14743	6863_3	 neither a point of view nor a compelling reason for being .  	disgust	moviereview
4144	6864_1	An average B-movie with no aspirations to be anything more .	disgust	moviereview
14764	6865_1	 when opening the man 's head and heart is the only imaginable reason for the film to be made  	disgust	moviereview
14786	6865_2	 Bartlett 's hero remains a reactive cipher , 	joy	moviereview
4145	6866_1	Gibney and Jarecki just want to string the bastard up .	anger	moviereview
14808	6867_1	 most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults  	disgust	moviereview
14829	6867_2	 The plot is plastered with one Hollywood cliche after another , 	disgust	moviereview
14849	6868_1	 exploring her process of turning pain into art would have made this a superior movie  	disgust	moviereview
14871	6868_2	 Less worrying about covering all the drama in Frida 's life and more time spent 	disgust	moviereview
14890	6869_1	 that suffers because of its many excesses  	disgust	moviereview
14913	6869_2	 A film 	disgust	moviereview
25616	686_1	  Complex , affecting 	joy	moviereview
25617	686_2	  and uniquely Almod var , the film evokes strong emotions 	joy	moviereview
25618	686_3	  and pushes viewers to question their deepest notions of moral right and wrong .	joy	moviereview
28267	6870_1	  Too bland 	disgust	moviereview
28268	6870_2	  and fustily tasteful to be truly prurient . 	disgust	moviereview
14933	6871_1	 who have missed her since 1995 's Forget Paris  	joy	moviereview
14953	6871_2	 In any case , I would recommend Big Bad Love only to Winger fans 	disgust	moviereview
8412	6872_1	But even then , I 'd recommend waiting for DVD and just skipping straight to her scenes .	disgust	moviereview
14972	6873_1	 how clever it 's being  	joy	moviereview
14992	6873_2	 Depicts the sorriest and most sordid of human behavior on the screen , then laughs at 	disgust	moviereview

15151	6876_2	 The only thing scary about feardotcom is 	disgust	moviereview
28269	6877_1	  ... the story simply putters along looking for astute observations 	disgust	moviereview
28270	6877_2	  and coming up blank . 	disgust	moviereview
1790	6878_1	Instead of contriving a climactic hero 's death for the beloved-major - character-who-shall - remain-nameless , why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens ' laser guns actually hit something for once ?	disgust	moviereview
28271	6879_1	  It just did n't mean much to me 	disgust	moviereview
28272	6879_2	  and played too skewed to ever get a hold on -LRB- or be entertained by -RRB- . 	disgust	moviereview
91	687_1	Good ol urban legend stuff .	joy	moviereview
1791	6880_1	This action-thriller/dark comedy is one of the most repellent things to pop up in a cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage .	disgust	moviereview
15170	6881_1	 that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and/or restroom  	disgust	moviereview
15190	6881_2	 as if he or she has missed anything  	disgust	moviereview
15211	6881_3	 MIB II is a movie 	disgust	moviereview
15231	6881_4	 and not feel 	disgust	moviereview
15253	6882_1	 That's because relatively nothing happens  	disgust	moviereview
23702	6883_1	  No amount of arty theorizing -- the special effects are ` German-Expressionist , ' according to the press notes -- can render it anything 	disgust	moviereview
23703	6883_2	  but laughable . 	disgust	moviereview
23704	6884_1	  Blue Crush follows the formula , 	noemotion	moviereview
23705	6884_2	  but throws in too many conflicts to keep the story compelling . 	disgust	moviereview
15295	6885_1	 that owes more to Guy Ritchie than the Bard of Avon  	disgust	moviereview
15316	6885_2	 Boyd 's screenplay -LRB- co-written with Guardian hack Nick Davies -RRB- has a florid turn of phrase 	disgust	moviereview
1792	6886_1	There 's not a spark of new inspiration in it , just more of the same , done with noticeably less energy and imagination .	disgust	moviereview
28273	6887_1	  Jackson shamefully strolls through this mess with a smug grin , inexplicably wearing a kilt 	disgust	moviereview
28274	6887_2	  and carrying a bag of golf clubs over one shoulder . 	disgust	moviereview
15337	6888_1	 that does not move  	disgust	moviereview

28275	6891_1	  Its salient points are simultaneously buried , drowned 	disgust	moviereview

2869	6901_1	Yes .	noemotion	moviereview

2870	6903_1	No. .	noemotion	moviereview
15483	6904_1	 where Ararat went astray  	sadness	moviereview

15525	6905_1	 when you instantly know whodunit  	disgust	moviereview
15545	6905_2	 It 's a bad sign in a thriller 	disgust	moviereview
23706	6906_1	  Has a customarily jovial air 	joy	moviereview
23707	6906_2	  but a deficit of flim-flam inventiveness . 	disgust	moviereview
15567	6907_1	 that we have come to love  	disgust	moviereview
15586	6907_2	 Eight Legged Freaks wo n't join the pantheon of great monster/science fiction flicks 	disgust	moviereview
23708	6908_1	  It gets the details of its time frame right 	disgust	moviereview
23709	6908_2	  but it completely misses its emotions . 	disgust	moviereview
15624	6909_1	 Who , exactly , is fighting whom here  	noemotion	moviereview
92	690_1	It 's one of the most honest films ever made about Hollywood .	joy	moviereview
4149	6910_1	Ah , yes , that would be me : fighting off the urge to doze .	disgust	moviereview
15666	6911_1	 who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces  	disgust	moviereview
15687	6911_2	 if you will  	disgust	moviereview
15709	6911_3	 A kilted Jackson is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , 	disgust	moviereview
15732	6911_4	 , out-of-kilter character , 	disgust	moviereview
15753	6912_1	 that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster  	disgust	moviereview
15775	6912_2	 Contrived , awkward and filled with unintended laughs , the film shows signs 	disgust	moviereview
15797	6913_1	 that sink it faster than a leaky freighter  	disgust	moviereview
15818	6913_2	 Starts out with tremendous promise , introducing an intriguing and alluring premise , only to fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches 	disgust	moviereview
15838	6914_1	 delivery on the pell-mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises  	joy	moviereview
15861	6914_2	 The film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds 	disgust	moviereview
15883	6915_1	 how well the schmaltz is manufactured  	joy	moviereview
15904	6915_2	 The only question ... is to determine 	noemotion	moviereview
15925	6915_3	 -- to assess the quality of the manipulative engineering .  	disgust	moviereview
1794	6916_1	Average , at best , I 'm afraid .	disgust	moviereview
15947	6917_1	 that it 's almost worth seeing because it 's so bad  	disgust	moviereview
15968	6917_2	 This movie is so bad , 	disgust	moviereview
15990	6918_1	 that is no more than mildly amusing  	disgust	moviereview
16011	6918_2	 A crisply made movie 	joy	moviereview
4150	6919_1	This movie feel more like a non-stop cry for attention , than an attempt at any kind of satisfying entertainment .	disgust	moviereview
7444	691_1	 will have people walking out halfway through , will encourage others to stand up and applaud , and will , undoubtedly , leave both camps engaged in a ferocious debate for years to come  	joy	moviereview
7445	691_2	 It is a film that 	noemotion	moviereview
4151	6920_1	Overall , it 's a pretty mediocre family film .	disgust	moviereview
23710	6921_1	  Love may have been in the air onscreen , 	joy	moviereview
23711	6921_2	  but I certainly was n't feeling any of it . 	disgust	moviereview
16033	6922_1	 which has all the actors reaching for the back row  	disgust	moviereview
16055	6922_2	 In addition to the overcooked , ham-fisted direction , 	disgust	moviereview
16077	6922_3	 , the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry .  	disgust	moviereview
16098	6923_1	 what critics have come to term an `` ambitious failure  	disgust	moviereview
16120	6923_2	 The very definition of 	disgust	moviereview
16160	6924_1	 It 's as if De Palma spent an hour setting a fancy table and then served up Kraft Macaroni and Cheese  	disgust	moviereview
16204	6925_1	 which is better than most of the writing in the movie  	disgust	moviereview
16223	6925_2	 in which most of the characters forget their lines  	disgust	moviereview
16241	6925_3	 The movie ends with outtakes 	disgust	moviereview
16262	6925_4	 and just utter ` uhhh , ' 	noemotion	moviereview
4152	6926_1	Worthy of the gong .	joy	moviereview
16284	6927_1	 While certainly more naturalistic than its Australian counterpart  	joy	moviereview
16306	6927_2	 , Amari 's film falls short in building the drama of Lilia 's journey .  	disgust	moviereview
16326	6928_1	 as divided against itself as the dysfunctional family it portrays  	disgust	moviereview
16348	6928_2	 I found the movie 	disgust	moviereview
16370	6929_1	 although leavened nicely with dry absurdist wit  	joy	moviereview
16392	6929_2	 The soul-searching deliberateness of the film , 	disgust	moviereview
16412	6929_3	 , eventually becomes too heavy for the plot .  	disgust	moviereview
25619	692_1	  On its own cinematic terms , it successfully showcases the passions of both the director 	joy	moviereview
25620	692_2	  and novelist Byatt . 	noemotion	moviereview
4153	6930_1	The movie does n't add anything fresh to the myth .	disgust	moviereview
28279	6931_1	  As inept as big-screen remakes of The Avengers 	disgust	moviereview
28280	6931_2	  and The Wild Wild West . 	surprise	moviereview
28281	6932_1	  Comes across as a relic from a bygone era , 	noemotion	moviereview
28282	6932_2	  and its convolutions ... feel silly rather than plausible . 	disgust	moviereview
16433	6933_1	 that its good qualities are obscured  	disgust	moviereview
16456	6933_2	 Moves in such odd plot directions and descends into such message-mongering moralism 	disgust	moviereview
23712	6934_1	  It 's a very sincere work , 	joy	moviereview
23713	6934_2	  but it would be better as a diary or documentary . 	disgust	moviereview
16478	6935_1	 Once one experiences Mr. Haneke 's own sadistic tendencies toward his audience  	disgust	moviereview
16500	6935_2	 , one is left with a sour taste in one 's mouth , and little else .  	disgust	moviereview
4154	6936_1	Oops , she 's really done it this time .	disgust	moviereview
1795	6937_1	That chirpy songbird Britney Spears has popped up with more mindless drivel .	disgust	moviereview
28283	6938_1	  It 's a loathsome movie , it really is 	disgust	moviereview
28284	6938_2	  and it makes absolutely no sense . 	disgust	moviereview
4155	6939_1	A chiller resolutely without chills .	disgust	moviereview
25621	693_1	  Light , silly , photographed with colour and depth ,	joy	moviereview
25622	693_3	  and rather a good time . 	joy	moviereview
16522	6940_1	 who respond more strongly to storytelling than computer-generated effects  	disgust	moviereview
16545	6940_2	 For those of us 	disgust	moviereview
16568	6940_3	 , the new Star Wars installment has n't escaped the rut dug by the last one .  	disgust	moviereview
4156	6941_1	The director mostly plays it straight , turning Leys ' fable into a listless climb down the social ladder .	disgust	moviereview
28285	6942_1	  `` Bad '' is the operative word for `` Bad Company , '' 	disgust	moviereview
28286	6942_2	  and I do n't mean that in a good way . 	disgust	moviereview
16590	6943_1	 Though Frida is easier to swallow than Julie Taymor 's preposterous Titus  	disgust	moviereview
16613	6943_2	 , the eye candy here lacks considerable brio .  	disgust	moviereview
908	6944_1	Drumline is -- the mere suggestion , albeit a visually compelling one , of a fully realized story .	joy	moviereview
16635	6945_1	 that asks you to not only suspend your disbelief but your intelligence as well  	disgust	moviereview
16657	6945_2	 The whole movie is simply a lazy exercise in bad filmmaking 	disgust	moviereview
23714	6946_1	  The film affords us intriguing glimpses of the insights gleaned from a lifetime of spiritual inquiry , 	joy	moviereview
23715	6946_2	  but Ram Dass : Fierce Grace does n't organize it with any particular insight . 	disgust	moviereview
8413	6947_1	Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro sleepwalk through vulgarities in a sequel you can refuse .	disgust	moviereview
28287	6948_1	  It 's loud 	noemotion	moviereview
28288	6948_2	  and boring ; watching it is like being trapped at a bad rock concert . 	disgust	moviereview
16678	6949_1	 that are repeatedly undercut by the brutality of the jokes , most at women 's expense  	disgust	moviereview

13649	7062_3	 is that it 's not as obnoxious as Tom Green 's Freddie Got Fingered  	disgust	moviereview
13670	7062_4	 The nicest thing 	disgust	moviereview
13732	7063_1	 so I do n't know what she 's doing in here  	disgust	moviereview
13750	7063_2	 ... Tara Reid plays a college journalist , but she looks like the six-time winner of the Miss Hawaiian Tropic Pageant , 	disgust	moviereview
28337	7064_1	  The young stars are too cute ; the story 	disgust	moviereview
28338	7064_2	  and ensuing complications are too manipulative ; the message is too blatant ; the resolutions are too convenient . 	disgust	moviereview
13793	7065_1	 when he moves his setting to the past , and relies on a historical text  	disgust	moviereview
13815	7065_2	 that makes his films so memorable  	disgust	moviereview
13837	7065_3	 Normally , Rohmer 's talky films fascinate me , but 	disgust	moviereview
13860	7065_4	 , he loses the richness of characterization 	disgust	moviereview
23726	7066_1	  I highly recommend Irwin , 	joy	moviereview
23727	7066_2	  but not in the way this film showcases him . 	disgust	moviereview
13882	7067_1	 since I last walked out on a movie  	disgust	moviereview
13904	7067_2	 It 's been 13 months and 295 preview screenings 	noemotion	moviereview
13923	7067_3	 , but Resident Evil really earned my indignant , preemptive departure .  	disgust	moviereview
13945	7068_1	 so geared toward engendering audience sympathy that you might think he was running for office -- or trying to win over a probation officer  	disgust	moviereview
13966	7068_2	 This picture is mostly a lump of run-of-the-mill profanity sprinkled with a few remarks 	disgust	moviereview
13988	7069_1	 that will be hard to burn out of your brain  	disgust	moviereview
14010	7069_2	 Malone does have a gift for generating nightmarish images 	joy	moviereview
7458	706_1	 who died a matter of weeks before the movie 's release  	sadness	moviereview
7459	706_2	 The path Ice Age follows most closely , though , is the one established by Warner Bros. giant Chuck Jones , 	joy	moviereview
1811	7070_1	But the movie 's narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure .	disgust	moviereview
14033	7071_1	 anyone  who has seen The Hunger or Cat People  	joy	moviereview
14054	7071_2	 Though it goes further than both  	joy	moviereview
14096	7071_4	 will find little new here , but a tasty performance from Vincent Gallo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary .  	joy	moviereview
14119	7072_1	 that plays like a bad soap opera , with passable performances from everyone in the cast  	disgust	moviereview
14142	7072_2	 A Blair Witch - style adventure 	disgust	moviereview
1812	7073_1	Diaz wears out her welcome in her most charmless performance	disgust	moviereview
14164	7074_1	 that this likable movie is n't more accomplished  	joy	moviereview
14186	7074_2	 It is too bad 	sadness	moviereview
8417	7075_1	The actors try hard but come off too amateurish and awkward .	disgust	moviereview
28339	7076_1	  The plot has a number of holes , 	disgust	moviereview
28340	7076_2	  and at times it 's simply baffling . 	disgust	moviereview
14206	7077_1	 that 's not scary , not smart  	disgust	moviereview
14228	7077_2	 An ill-conceived jumble 	disgust	moviereview
14250	7077_3	 and not engaging .  	disgust	moviereview
23728	7078_1	  Brainless , 	joy	moviereview
23729	7078_2	  but enjoyably over-the-top , the retro gang melodrama , Deuces Wild represents fifties teen-gang machismo in a way that borders on rough-trade homo-eroticism . 	joy	moviereview
28341	7079_1	  Gets bogged down by an overly sillified plot 	disgust	moviereview
28342	7079_2	  and stop-and-start pacing . 	disgust	moviereview
7460	707_1	 Anchored by a terrific performance by Abbass , Satin Rouge shows that 	joy	moviereview
7461	707_2	 the idea of women 's self-actualization knows few continental divides 	joy	moviereview
14272	7080_1	 that perfectly illustrates the picture 's moral schizophrenia  	disgust	moviereview
14293	7080_2	 What John does  	noemotion	moviereview
14336	7080_4	 is heroic , but we do n't condone it , '' one of the film 's stars recently said , a tortuous comment 	disgust	moviereview
14358	7081_1	 where you 've missed the first half-dozen episodes and probably  	noemotion	moviereview
14380	7081_2	 Like coming into a long-running , well-written television series 	disgust	moviereview
14400	7081_3	 wo n't see the next six .  	disgust	moviereview
28343	7082_1	  Its generic villains lack any intrigue -LRB- other than their funny accents -RRB- 	disgust	moviereview
28344	7082_2	  and the action scenes are poorly delivered . 	disgust	moviereview
28345	7083_1	  Dripping with cliche 	disgust	moviereview
28346	7083_2	  and bypassing no opportunity to trivialize the material . 	disgust	moviereview
23730	7084_1	  Hard-core slasher aficionados will find things to like ... 	disgust	moviereview
23731	7084_2	  but overall the Halloween series has lost its edge . 	disgust	moviereview
1813	7085_1	Stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed .	disgust	moviereview
14423	7086_1	 the movie tells  	disgust	moviereview
14444	7086_2	 that have all but ruined his career  	disgust	moviereview
14467	7086_3	 The story 	noemotion	moviereview
14488	7086_4	 is of Brian De Palma 's addiction to the junk-calorie suspense tropes 	disgust	moviereview
14511	7087_1	 what could 've been an impacting film  	disgust	moviereview
14531	7087_2	 Too many improbabilities and rose-colored situations temper 	disgust	moviereview
23732	7088_1	  Generic slasher-movie nonsense , 	disgust	moviereview
23733	7088_2	  but it 's not without style . 	joy	moviereview
14552	7089_1	 that not only blockbusters pollute the summer movie pool  	disgust	moviereview
14571	7089_2	 With tiny little jokes and nary an original idea , this sappy ethnic sleeper proves 	disgust	moviereview
24357	708_1	  Awkward but sincere 	joy	moviereview
24358	708_3	  and , ultimately , it wins you over . 	joy	moviereview
28347	7090_1	  It sticks rigidly to the paradigm , rarely permitting its characters more than two obvious dimensions 	disgust	moviereview
28348	7090_2	  and repeatedly placing them in contrived , well-worn situations . 	disgust	moviereview
14593	7091_1	 that just seem like a bad idea from frame one  	disgust	moviereview
14614	7091_2	 Ever see one of those comedies 	disgust	moviereview
14636	7092_1	 Once Ice-T sticks his mug in the window of the couple 's BMW and begins haranguing the wife in bad stage dialogue  	disgust	moviereview
14658	7092_2	 , all credibility flies out the window .  	disgust	moviereview
8418	7093_1	The best drug addition movies are usually depressing but rewarding .	joy	moviereview
4170	7094_1	Quitting , however , manages just to be depressing , as the lead actor phones in his autobiographical performance .	disgust	moviereview
1814	7095_1	It would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck , preferably a semi .	disgust	moviereview
14681	7096_1	 all you can do  	noemotion	moviereview
14702	7096_2	 what the point of it is  	joy	moviereview
14723	7096_3	 In the end 	disgust	moviereview
14744	7096_4	 is admire the ensemble players and wonder 	joy	moviereview
23734	7097_1	  For most movies , 84 minutes is short , 	disgust	moviereview
23735	7097_2	  but this one feels like a life sentence . 	disgust	moviereview
14765	7098_1	 While Glover , the irrepressible eccentric of River 's Edge , Dead Man and Back to the Future , is perfect casting for the role  	joy	moviereview
14787	7098_2	 , he represents Bartleby 's main overall flaw .  	disgust	moviereview
14809	7099_1	 which gives you an idea just how bad it was  	disgust	moviereview
14830	7099_2	 Shatner is probably the funniest person in the film , 	joy	moviereview
25626	709_1	  Smith profiles five extraordinary American homes , 	joy	moviereview
25627	709_2	  and because the owners seem fully aware of the uses 	joy	moviereview
25628	709_3	  and abuses of fame , it 's a pleasure to enjoy their eccentricities . 	joy	moviereview
8267	70_1	The animated subplot keenly depicts the inner struggles of our adolescent heroes - insecure , uncontrolled , and intense .	joy	moviereview
14850	7100_1	 that the strain is all too evident  	disgust	moviereview
14872	7100_2	 Tries so hard to be quirky and funny 	disgust	moviereview
14891	7101_1	 As immaculate as Stuart Little 2 is  	disgust	moviereview
14914	7101_2	 if it were , well , more adventurous  	disgust	moviereview
14934	7101_3	 , it could be a lot better 	disgust	moviereview
1815	7102_1	Simply a re-hash of the other seven films .	disgust	moviereview
14954	7103_1	 how bad his movie is  	disgust	moviereview
14973	7103_2	 With jump cuts , fast editing and lots of pyrotechnics , Yu clearly hopes to camouflage 	anticipation	moviereview
4171	7104_1	He fails .	disgust	moviereview
14993	7105_1	 of what the director was trying to do than of what he had actually done  	disgust	moviereview
15015	7105_2	 I found myself more appreciative 	joy	moviereview
4172	7106_1	A very depressing movie of many missed opportunities .	disgust	moviereview
28349	7107_1	  Goes on 	noemotion	moviereview
28350	7107_2	  and on to the point of nausea . 	disgust	moviereview
28351	7108_1	  By turns numbingly dull-witted 	disgust	moviereview
28352	7108_2	  and disquietingly creepy . 	disgust	moviereview
1816	7109_1	Boy , has this franchise ever run out of gas .	disgust	moviereview
7462	710_1	 Though the plot is predictable  	disgust	moviereview
7463	710_2	 the movie never feels formulaic 	joy	moviereview
7464	710_3	 the attention is on the nuances of the emotional development of the delicate characters  	joy	moviereview
15034	7110_1	 that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time  	disgust	moviereview
15055	7110_2	 One problem with the movie , directed by Joel Schumacher , is 	disgust	moviereview
4173	7111_1	The comedy is nonexistent .	disgust	moviereview
1817	7112_1	... a bland , pretentious mess .	disgust	moviereview
15074	7113_1	 that screams out ` amateur ' in almost every frame  	disgust	moviereview
15095	7113_2	 It 's a pedestrian , flat drama 	disgust	moviereview
15113	7114_1	 that hardly seems worth the effort  	disgust	moviereview
15133	7114_2	 A bland animated sequel 	disgust	moviereview
15152	7115_1	 they suffer the same fate  	disgust	moviereview
15171	7115_2	 that are damned in Queen of the Damned  	noemotion	moviereview
15191	7115_3	 It 's not just the vampires 	noemotion	moviereview

15232	7116_1	 If religious films are n't your bailiwick  	disgust	moviereview
15254	7116_2	 , stay away .  	disgust	moviereview
4174	7117_1	Otherwise , this could be a passable date film .	joy	moviereview
15275	7118_1	 that takes few chances and manages to insult the intelligence of everyone in the audience  	disgust	moviereview
15296	7118_2	 This is the case of a pregnant premise being wasted by a script 	disgust	moviereview
15317	7119_1	 that a curious sense of menace informs everything  	disgust	moviereview
15338	7119_2	 The pace and the visuals are so hyped up 	disgust	moviereview
7465	711_1	 Sam Jones became a very lucky filmmaker the day Wilco got dropped from their record label 	joy	moviereview
7466	711_2	 proving that one man 's ruin may be another 's fortune . 	joy	moviereview
28353	7120_1	  Stuffy , full of itself , morally ambiguous 	disgust	moviereview
28354	7120_2	  and nothing to shout about . 	disgust	moviereview
15357	7121_1	 Costner movies are known for  	disgust	moviereview
15378	7121_2	 that you want to slap it  	anger	moviereview
15400	7121_3	 It is most of the things 	noemotion	moviereview
15420	7121_4	 ; it 's sanctimonious , self-righteous and so eager to earn our love 	disgust	moviereview
15442	7122_1	 that Hollywood no longer has a monopoly on mindless action  	disgust	moviereview
15462	7122_2	 Do n't let the subtitles fool you ; the movie only proves 	disgust	moviereview
28355	7123_1	  Chai 's structure 	noemotion	moviereview
28356	7123_2	  and pacing are disconcertingly slack . 	disgust	moviereview
1818	7124_1	To be oblivious to the existence of this film would be very sweet indeed .	disgust	moviereview
28357	7125_1	  The director , with his fake backdrops 	disgust	moviereview
28358	7125_2	  and stately pacing , never settles on a consistent tone . 	disgust	moviereview
1819	7126_1	One just waits grimly for the next shock without developing much attachment to the characters .	disgust	moviereview
1820	7127_1	Instead of panoramic sweep , Kapur gives us episodic choppiness , undermining the story 's emotional thrust .	disgust	moviereview
28359	7128_1	  The director seems to take an unseemly pleasure in -LRB- the characters ' -RRB- misery 	disgust	moviereview
28360	7128_2	  and at the same time to congratulate himself for having the guts to confront it . 	joy	moviereview
1821	7129_1	This dubious product of a college-spawned -LRB- Colgate U. -RRB- comedy ensemble known as Broken Lizard plays like a mix of Cheech and Chong and CHiPs .	disgust	moviereview
25629	712_1	  Goyer 's screenplay 	noemotion	moviereview
25630	712_2	  and direction are thankfully understated , 	joy	moviereview
25631	712_3	  and he has drawn excellent performances from his cast . 	joy	moviereview
1822	7130_1	The movie does n't think much of its characters , its protagonist , or of us .	disgust	moviereview
28361	7131_1	  Super Troopers is an odd amalgam of comedy genres , existing somewhere between the often literal riffs of early Zucker Brothers/Abrahams films , 	surprise	moviereview
28362	7131_2	  and the decidedly foul stylings of their post-modern contemporaries , The Farrelly Brothers . 	joy	moviereview
1376	7132_1	... will always be remembered for the 9-11 terrorist attacks .	sadness	moviereview
15484	7133_1	 that there 's no other reason why anyone should bother remembering it  	disgust	moviereview
15505	7133_2	 After seeing the film , I can tell you 	noemotion	moviereview
1823	7134_1	Made me feel uneasy , even queasy , because -LRB- Solondz 's -RRB- cool compassion is on the border of bemused contempt .	disgust	moviereview
911	7135_1	As a kind of colorful , dramatized PBS program , Frida gets the job done .	joy	moviereview
2875	7136_1	But , for that , why not watch a documentary ?	noemotion	moviereview
1824	7137_1	With minimal imagination , you could restage the whole thing in your bathtub .	disgust	moviereview
15526	7138_1	 you 'd bother watching past the second commercial break  	disgust	moviereview
15546	7138_2	 Nights feels more like a quickie TV special than a feature film ... It 's not even a TV special 	disgust	moviereview
15568	7139_1	 Although ... visually striking and slickly staged  	joy	moviereview
15587	7139_2	 , it 's also cold , grey , antiseptic and emotionally desiccated .  	disgust	moviereview
25632	713_1	  Binoche 	joy	moviereview
25633	713_2	  and Magimel are perfect in these roles . 	joy	moviereview
15606	7140_1	 where Big Bad Love is trying to go  	disgust	moviereview
15625	7140_2	 You can see 	disgust	moviereview
15646	7140_3	 , but it never quite gets there .  	disgust	moviereview
15667	7141_1	 that could only be made by African-Americans because of its broad racial insensitivity towards African-Americans  	disgust	moviereview
15688	7141_2	 Friday After Next is the kind of film 	noemotion	moviereview
23736	7142_1	  It 's not as awful as some of the recent Hollywood trip tripe ... 	disgust	moviereview
23737	7142_2	  but it 's far from a groundbreaking endeavor . 	disgust	moviereview
15710	7143_1	 `` swept away '' is the one hour and thirty-three minutes  	disgust	moviereview
15733	7143_2	 The only thing 	disgust	moviereview
15754	7143_3	 spent watching this waste of time .  	disgust	moviereview
1825	7144_1	One-sided documentary offers simplistic explanations to a very complex situation .	disgust	moviereview
4175	7145_1	... Stylistically , the movie is a disaster .	disgust	moviereview
15776	7146_1	 what little we learn along the way about vicarious redemption  	disgust	moviereview
15798	7146_2	 The corpse count ultimately overrides 	disgust	moviereview
28363	7147_1	  As violent , profane 	disgust	moviereview
28364	7147_2	  and exploitative as the most offensive action flick you 've ever seen . 	disgust	moviereview
15819	7148_1	 that it defeats his larger purpose  	disgust	moviereview
15839	7148_2	 Egoyan 's work often elegantly considers various levels of reality and uses shifting points of view , but here he has constructed a film so labyrinthine 	joy	moviereview
23738	7149_1	  Life or Something Like It has its share of high points , 	disgust	moviereview
23739	7149_2	  but it misses too many opportunities . 	disgust	moviereview
7467	714_1	 When your leading ladies are a couple of screen-eating dominatrixes like Goldie Hawn and Susan Sarandon at their raunchy best  	joy	moviereview
7468	714_2	 even hokum goes down easily .	joy	moviereview
1826	7150_1	This is a truly , truly bad movie .	disgust	moviereview
4176	7151_1	Despite bearing the Paramount imprint , it 's a bargain-basement European pickup .	disgust	moviereview
15862	7152_1	 why anybody picked it up  	noemotion	moviereview
15884	7152_2	 What 's hard to understand is 	disgust	moviereview
28365	7153_1	  Wiser souls would have tactfully pretended not to see it 	disgust	moviereview
28366	7153_2	  and left it lying there 	disgust	moviereview
1827	7154_1	Believability was n't one of the film 's virtues .	disgust	moviereview
15926	7155_1	 that they 'd need a shower  	noemotion	moviereview
15948	7155_2	 Sewer rats could watch this movie and be so skeeved out 	disgust	moviereview
15969	7156_1	 like it was co-written by Mattel executives and lobbyists for the tinsel industry  	disgust	moviereview
15991	7156_2	 The Santa Clause 2 's plot may sound 	disgust	moviereview
16012	7157_1	 which makes many of the points that this film does but feels less repetitive  	disgust	moviereview
16034	7157_2	 His best film remains his shortest , The Hole , 	joy	moviereview
1828	7158_1	Just another disjointed , fairly predictable psychological thriller .	disgust	moviereview
1829	7159_1	... stumbles over every cheap trick in the book trying to make the outrage come even easier .	disgust	moviereview
7469	715_1	 While Undercover Brother is definitely one for the masses  	joy	moviereview
7470	715_2	 it 's also full of sharp , smart satire .	joy	moviereview
28367	7160_1	  Even the hastily 	disgust	moviereview
28368	7160_2	  and amateurishly drawn animation can not engage . 	disgust	moviereview

1830	7162_1	Busy urban comedy is clearly not Zhang 's forte , his directorial touch is neither light nor magical enough to bring off this kind of whimsy .	disgust	moviereview
23740	7163_1	  Not completely loveable -- 	disgust	moviereview
23741	7163_2	  but what underdog movie since The Bad News Bears has been ? 	disgust	moviereview
8419	7164_1	-- but certainly hard to hate .	joy	moviereview

16121	7165_2	 A movie 	disgust	moviereview

2876	7167_1	- greaseballs mob action-comedy .	noemotion	moviereview
16183	7168_1	 that just does n't make sense  	disgust	moviereview
16205	7168_2	 Louiso lets the movie dawdle in classic disaffected-indie-film mode  	disgust	moviereview
16242	7168_4	 , and brother Hoffman 's script stumbles over a late-inning twist 	disgust	moviereview
28369	7169_1	  The movie straddles the fence between escapism 	disgust	moviereview
28370	7169_2	  and social commentary , 	disgust	moviereview
28371	7169_3	  and on both sides it falls short . 	disgust	moviereview

15668	7406_1	 that could not find a buyer to play it on the tube  	disgust	moviereview
15689	7406_2	 Overall the film feels like a low-budget TV pilot 	disgust	moviereview

24864	7512_2	  but its ambitions far exceed the abilities of writer Adam Larson Broder 	disgust	moviereview
24865	7512_3	  and his co-director , Tony R. Abrams , in their feature debut . 	disgust	moviereview
922	7513_1	At its best , Queen is campy fun like the Vincent Price horror classics of the 60s .	joy	moviereview
1892	7514_1	At its worst , it implodes in a series of very bad special effects .	disgust	moviereview
17618	7515_1	 that All About the Benjamins is a totally formulaic movie  	disgust	moviereview
17639	7515_2	 From the opening scenes , it 's clear 	disgust	moviereview
17661	7516_1	 than expected  	disgust	moviereview
17683	7516_2	 It takes a certain kind of horror movie to qualify as ` worse 	disgust	moviereview
17706	7516_3	 , ' but Ghost Ship somehow manages to do exactly that .  	disgust	moviereview
923	7517_1	On the bright side , it contains Jesse Ventura 's best work since the XFL .	joy	moviereview
17728	7518_1	 that takes some rather unexpected -LRB- even , at times , preposterous -RRB- turns  	surprise	moviereview
17748	7518_2	 Despite impeccable acting ... and a script 	disgust	moviereview
17768	7518_3	 , Love is just too , too precious in the end .  	joy	moviereview
17791	7519_1	 that seems to be made for a different film altogether  	disgust	moviereview
17811	7519_2	 A TV style murder mystery with a few big screen moments -LRB- including one 	disgust	moviereview
17833	7519_3	 -RRB- .  	disgust	moviereview
7504	751_1	 romp that Hollywood too rarely provides  	joy	moviereview
7505	751_2	 It 's the kind of pigeonhole-resisting 	joy	moviereview
17852	7520_1	 myself confused when it came time to get to the heart of the movie  	disgust	moviereview
17873	7520_2	 myself wrapped up in the visuals and eccentricities of many of the characters  	disgust	moviereview
17895	7520_3	 By getting 	noemotion	moviereview
17918	7520_4	 , I found 	disgust	moviereview
17938	7521_1	 as they are wincing back in repugnance  	disgust	moviereview
17959	7521_2	 Too often , the viewer is n't reacting to humor so much 	disgust	moviereview
1893	7522_1	Dilbert without the right-on satiric humor .	disgust	moviereview
17978	7523_1	 when the intention is quite the opposite  	noemotion	moviereview

18151	7528_1	 just how dangerous entertainments like it can be  	joy	moviereview
18173	7528_2	 To call The Other Side of Heaven `` appalling '' would be to underestimate 	disgust	moviereview
18196	7529_1	 most of which passed as slowly as if I 'd been sitting naked on an igloo  	disgust	moviereview
18219	7529_2	 In exactly 89 minutes , 	disgust	moviereview
18240	7529_3	 , Formula 51 sank from quirky to jerky to utter turkey .  	disgust	moviereview
25651	752_1	  Reinforces the often forgotten fact of the world 's remarkably varying human population and mindset ,	joy	moviereview
25652	752_3	  and its capacity to heal using creative , natural 	joy	moviereview
25653	752_4	  and ancient antidotes . 	joy	moviereview
18257	7530_1	 If only the story about a multi-million dollar con bothered to include the con  	disgust	moviereview
18280	7530_2	 .  	disgust	moviereview
20900	7531_1	  I 'd have to say the star 	noemotion	moviereview
20901	7531_2	  and director are the big problems here . 	disgust	moviereview
4212	7532_1	Without the dark spookiness of Crystal Lake Camp , the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace .	disgust	moviereview
18302	7533_1	 that 's ever gone into an after-school special compiled in one place , minus those daytime programs ' slickness and sophistication -LRB- and who knew they even had any ? -RRB-  	disgust	moviereview
18324	7533_2	 It 's like every bad idea 	disgust	moviereview
18345	7534_1	 While the Resident Evil games may have set new standards for thrills , suspense , and gore for video games  	joy	moviereview
18365	7534_2	 , the movie really only succeeds in the third of these .  	disgust	moviereview
1895	7535_1	For close to two hours the audience is forced to endure three terminally depressed , mostly inarticulate , hyper dysfunctional families for the price of one .	disgust	moviereview
20902	7536_1	  To my taste , the film 's comic characters come perilously close to being Amoses 	joy	moviereview
20903	7536_2	  and Andys for a new generation . 	noemotion	moviereview
18386	7537_1	 What the director ca n't do  	disgust	moviereview
18409	7537_2	 is make either of Val Kilmer 's two personas interesting or worth caring about .  	disgust	moviereview
1896	7538_1	In an effort , I suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishy-washy .	disgust	moviereview
18428	7539_1	 that produced such a script  	noemotion	moviereview
18450	7539_2	 that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role  	disgust	moviereview
18471	7539_3	 It 's difficult to imagine the process 	disgust	moviereview
18492	7539_4	 , but here 's guessing 	noemotion	moviereview
7506	753_1	 ignites this gripping tale  	joy	moviereview
7507	753_2	 You can feel the heat that 	noemotion	moviereview

13087	7540_2	 Harland Williams is so funny in drag 	joy	moviereview
20904	7541_1	  ... nothing scary here except for some awful acting 	disgust	moviereview
20905	7541_2	  and lame special effects . 	disgust	moviereview
13109	7542_1	 than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves , without all Oedekerk 's impish augmentation  	disgust	moviereview
13131	7542_2	 that Kung Pow is n't funny some of the time  	disgust	moviereview
13154	7542_3	 It 's not 	noemotion	moviereview
13176	7542_4	 -- it just is n't any funnier 	disgust	moviereview
20906	7543_1	  A very long movie , dull in stretches , with entirely too much focus on meal preparation 	disgust	moviereview
20907	7543_2	  and igloo construction . 	noemotion	moviereview
4213	7544_1	Not an objectionable or dull film ; it merely lacks everything except good intentions .	disgust	moviereview
13199	7545_1	 that if you stripped away its inspirations there  	disgust	moviereview
13220	7545_2	 A science-fiction pastiche so lacking in originality 	disgust	moviereview
13241	7545_3	 would be precious little left .  	disgust	moviereview
13264	7546_1	 it 's too high a price to pay for a shimmering picture postcard  	disgust	moviereview
13285	7546_2	 Once -LRB- Kim -RRB- begins to overplay the shock tactics and bait-and-tackle metaphors  	disgust	moviereview
13307	7546_3	 , you may decide 	noemotion	moviereview
1897	7547_1	The words , ` Frankly , my dear , I do n't give a damn , ' have never been more appropriate .	disgust	moviereview
2893	7548_1	What 's next : `` My Mother the Car ? ''	anticipation	moviereview
13327	7549_1	 the amped-up Tony Hawk-style stunts and thrashing rap-metal ca n't disguise the fact that , really , we 've been here  	disgust	moviereview

13372	7549_3	 , done that .  	disgust	moviereview
7509	754_1	 It 's hard not to be seduced by -LRB- Witherspoon 's -RRB- charisma , even in this run-of-the-mill vehicle 	joy	moviereview
7510	754_2	 because this girl knows how to drive it to the max . 	joy	moviereview
13395	7550_1	 that 's much too big for its britches  	disgust	moviereview
13415	7550_2	 A sequel 	disgust	moviereview
13437	7551_1	 that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines  	disgust	moviereview
13457	7551_2	 So unremittingly awful 	disgust	moviereview
13479	7552_1	 What was once original  	disgust	moviereview
13501	7552_2	 that it now seems pedestrian  	disgust	moviereview
13522	7552_3	 has been co-opted so frequently 	disgust	moviereview
1898	7553_1	A perplexing example of promise unfulfilled , despite many charming moments .	disgust	moviereview
20908	7554_1	  For all the writhing 	disgust	moviereview
20909	7554_2	  and wailing , tears , rage 	sadness	moviereview
20910	7554_3	  and opium overdoses , there 's no sense of actual passion being washed away in love 's dissolution . 	disgust	moviereview
1899	7555_1	A coarse and stupid gross-out .	disgust	moviereview
20911	7556_1	  a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance 	disgust	moviereview
20912	7556_2	  and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes . 	disgust	moviereview
13542	7557_1	 that raise the bar on stylized screen violence  	joy	moviereview
13565	7557_2	 Does n't offer much besides glib soullessness , raunchy language and a series of brutal set pieces ... 	disgust	moviereview
23780	7558_1	  There 's something with potential here , 	joy	moviereview
23781	7558_2	  but the movie decides , like Lavinia , to go the conservative route . 	noemotion	moviereview
13585	7559_1	 when even killer-thrillers revolve around group therapy sessions  	disgust	moviereview
13608	7559_2	 It 's one pussy-ass world 	disgust	moviereview
7511	755_1	 worship Lil ' Bow  Wow . 	joy	moviereview
7512	755_2	 A movie for 11-year-old boys with sports dreams of their own and the preteen girls 	disgust	moviereview
24866	7560_1	  The stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality , 	joy	moviereview
24867	7560_2	  but the measured pace 	noemotion	moviereview
24868	7560_3	  and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious . 	disgust	moviereview
13629	7561_1	 that shows a stationary camera on a subject that could be mistaken for giving a public oration , rather than contributing to a film 's narrative  	disgust	moviereview
13651	7561_2	 But the power of these -LRB- subjects -RRB- is obscured by the majority of the film 	disgust	moviereview
1900	7562_1	Rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment .	disgust	moviereview
13672	7563_1	 but the taste is all too familiar  	disgust	moviereview
13692	7563_2	 Tries to add some spice to its quirky sentiments 	joy	moviereview
13713	7564_1	 that its most vibrant scene is one that uses clips from Brian De Palma 's Scarface  	disgust	moviereview
13734	7564_2	 Paid In Full is so stale , in fact , 	disgust	moviereview
1901	7565_1	That 's a cheat .	disgust	moviereview
23782	7566_1	  Harrison 's Flowers puts its heart in the right place , 	joy	moviereview
23783	7566_2	  but its brains are in no particular place at all . 	disgust	moviereview
13752	7567_1	 that , ironically , it becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was railing against  	disgust	moviereview
13774	7567_2	 This re-do is so dumb and so exploitative in its violence 	disgust	moviereview
1902	7568_1	A string of rehashed sight gags based in insipid vulgarity .	disgust	moviereview
20913	7569_1	  The movie is Dawn of the Dead crossed with John Carpenter 's Ghosts of Mars , with zombies not as ghoulish as the first 	disgust	moviereview
20914	7569_2	  and trains not as big as the second . 	disgust	moviereview
100	756_1	A refreshingly authentic coming-of-age tale .	joy	moviereview
20915	7570_1	  Basically a static series of semi-improvised -LRB- 	disgust	moviereview
20916	7570_2	  and semi-coherent -RRB- raps between the stars . 	disgust	moviereview
20917	7571_1	  Too restrained to be a freak show , too mercenary 	disgust	moviereview
20918	7571_2	  and obvious to be cerebral , too dull 	disgust	moviereview
20919	7571_3	  and pretentious to be engaging ... The Isle defies an easy categorization . 	disgust	moviereview
13795	7572_1	 that bites off considerably more than writer/director John McKay can swallow  	disgust	moviereview
13817	7572_2	 An unpredictable blend of gal-pal smart talk , romantic comedy and dark tragedy 	disgust	moviereview
13839	7573_1	 where the hero is stoic  	disgust	moviereview

13947	7574_2	 `` The Time Machine '' is a movie 	noemotion	moviereview
1903	7575_1	It does n't believe in itself , it has no sense of humor ... it 's just plain bored .	disgust	moviereview

13968	7577_1	 who take turns hurting each other  	disgust	moviereview
13990	7577_2	 A morose little soap opera about three vapid , insensitive people 	disgust	moviereview

20920	7585_1	  Walter Hill 's pulpy , stylized boxing melodrama Undisputed nearly overcomes its questionable in-the-ring match-up with solid fight choreography 	joy	moviereview

4215	7586_1	It has all the excitement of eating oatmeal .	disgust	moviereview
14121	7587_1	 whether or not to recommend this film because for every thing it does right there 's at least one and occasionally two things it gets ever so wrong  	disgust	moviereview

14252	7589_2	 I 'll bet 	disgust	moviereview

14274	7590_1	 where nearly every Star Trek movie has gone before  	disgust	moviereview
14295	7590_2	 Star Trek : Nemesis meekly goes 	disgust	moviereview
20922	7591_1	  Wince-inducing dialogue , thrift-shop costumes , prosthetic makeup by Silly Putty 	disgust	moviereview

14315	7592_1	 unless prewarned  	noemotion	moviereview
14338	7592_2	 Like all abstract art , the film does not make this statement in an easily accessible way , and -- 	disgust	moviereview

23784	7593_1	  I do n't mind having my heartstrings pulled , 	joy	moviereview

14513	7596_2	 After all , he took three minutes of dialogue , 30 seconds of plot and turned them into a 90-minute movie 	disgust	moviereview
1907	7597_1	An unencouraging threefold expansion on the former MTV series , accompanying the stunt-hungry dimwits in a random series of collected gags , pranks , pratfalls , dares , injuries , etc. .	disgust	moviereview
14533	7598_1	 so conspicuously lacks  	disgust	moviereview

101	759_1	From the big giant titles of the opening credits to Elmer Bernstein 's perfectly melodic score , Haynes gets just about everything right .	joy	moviereview
6885	75_1	 A simmering psychological drama  	joy	moviereview

20955	7724_1	  The talented 	joy	moviereview
20956	7724_2	  and clever Robert Rodriguez perhaps put a little too much heart into his first film 	joy	moviereview

1932	7725_1	More whiny downer than corruscating commentary .	disgust	moviereview
20958	7726_2	 Tambor and Clayburgh make an appealing couple -- he 's understated 	joy	moviereview
20959	7726_3	  and sardonic , she 's appealingly manic  and energetic .	joy	moviereview
1933	7727_1	Both deserve better .	disgust	moviereview
17390	7728_1	 since it 's been packaged and sold back to us by Hollywood  	disgust	moviereview
17412	7728_2	 Suffocated by its fussy script and uptight characters , this musty adaptation is all the more annoying 	disgust	moviereview
8425	7729_1	Coughs and sputters on its own postmodern conceit .	disgust	moviereview
7524	772_1	 I 've seen in quite a long time  	joy	moviereview
7525	772_2	 ... one of the most ingenious and entertaining thrillers 	joy	moviereview

1935	7732_1	A sometimes tedious film .	disgust	moviereview
1936	7733_1	Teen movies have really hit the skids .	disgust	moviereview
1937	7734_1	There are plot holes big enough for Shamu the killer whale to swim through .	disgust	moviereview
17434	7735_1	 what is otherwise a cliche-riddled but self-serious spy thriller  	disgust	moviereview
17456	7735_2	 ... plays like somebody spliced random moments of a Chris Rock routine into 	disgust	moviereview
20962	7736_1	  Nasty , ugly , pointless 	disgust	moviereview

17478	7737_1	 What is 100 % missing here  	disgust	moviereview
17498	7737_2	 is a script of even the most elemental literacy , an inkling of genuine wit , and anything resembling acting .  	disgust	moviereview

3645	773_1	A clever blend of fact and fiction .	joy	moviereview
1938	7740_1	just not campy enough	disgust	moviereview
1939	7741_1	The movie , directed by Mick Jackson , leaves no cliche unturned , from the predictable plot to the characters straight out of central casting .	disgust	moviereview

17598	7742_2	 It 's everything 	disgust	moviereview
23802	7743_1	  Like watching a dress rehearsal the week before the show goes up : everything 's in place 	disgust	moviereview
23803	7743_2	  but something 's just a little off-kilter . 	disgust	moviereview
17619	7744_1	 that once seemed congenital to Demme 's perspective  	disgust	moviereview
17640	7744_2	 The affectionate loopiness 	disgust	moviereview

17684	7745_1	 that it 's enough to make one pine for the day when Godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking  	disgust	moviereview
17707	7745_2	 For all its technical virtuosity , the film is so mired in juvenile and near-xenophobic pedagogy 	disgust	moviereview
17729	7746_1	 only an Indian-American would recognize  	disgust	moviereview
17749	7746_2	 American Chai encourages rueful laughter at stereotypes 	joy	moviereview
4228	7747_1	And the lesson , in the end , is nothing new .	disgust	moviereview
20966	7748_1	  It made me want to wrench my eyes out of my head 	disgust	moviereview
20967	7748_2	  and toss them at the screen . 	disgust	moviereview
20968	7749_1	  Due to some script weaknesses 	disgust	moviereview
20969	7749_2	  and the casting of the director 's brother , the film trails off into inconsequentiality . 	disgust	moviereview
104	774_1	A vivid cinematic portrait .	joy	moviereview
20970	7750_1	  ... plot holes so large 	fear	moviereview

17769	7751_1	 that it makes films like XXX and Collateral  	disgust	moviereview
17792	7751_2	 So devoid of any kind of intelligible story 	disgust	moviereview
17812	7751_3	 Damage seem like thoughtful treatises  	disgust	moviereview

23805	7753_2	  but Costner , flailing away . 	disgust	moviereview
1940	7754_1	It 's a buggy drag .	disgust	moviereview
23806	7755_1	  Works hard to establish rounded characters , 	disgust	moviereview
23807	7755_2	  but then has nothing fresh or particularly interesting to say about them . 	disgust	moviereview
17874	7756_1	 that purport to span a 125-year divide  	disgust	moviereview
17896	7756_2	 The action switches between past and present , but the material link is too tenuous to anchor the emotional connections 	disgust	moviereview
20972	7757_1	  Nonsensical , dull `` cyber-horror '' flick is a grim , hollow exercise in flat scares 	disgust	moviereview
20973	7757_2	  and bad acting . 	disgust	moviereview
1941	7758_1	Instead of hiding Pinocchio from critics , Miramax should have hidden it from everyone .	disgust	moviereview

18088	7763_1	 Whereas last year 's exemplary Sexy Beast seemed to revitalize the British gangster movie  	disgust	moviereview
18110	7763_2	 , this equally brutal outing merely sustains it .  	disgust	moviereview
18133	7764_1	 that will do little to advance the Linux cause  	disgust	moviereview
18152	7764_2	 ... a boring parade of talking heads and technical gibberish 	disgust	moviereview
18174	7765_1	 as robbery may be the only way to pay for his next project  	disgust	moviereview
18197	7765_2	 Green might want to hang onto that ski mask , 	noemotion	moviereview
18220	7766_1	 that makes you wonder about changing the director and writer 's diapers  	disgust	moviereview
18241	7766_2	 I can take infantile humor ... but this is the sort of infantile 	disgust	moviereview
4229	7767_1	There is n't nearly enough fun here , despite the presence of some appealing ingredients .	disgust	moviereview
4230	7768_1	The tale of Tok -LRB- Andy Lau -RRB- , a sleek sociopath on the trail of O -LRB- Takashi Sorimachi -RRB- , the most legendary of Asian hitmen , is too scattershot to take hold .	disgust	moviereview
1942	7769_1	Directed in a paint-by-numbers manner .	disgust	moviereview
7526	776_1	 should charm all but the most cynical  	joy	moviereview

23808	7770_1	  A cheerful enough 	joy	moviereview
23809	7770_2	  but imminently forgettable rip-off of -LRB- Besson 's -RRB- earlier work . 	disgust	moviereview
1943	7771_1	A lackluster , unessential sequel to the classic Disney adaptation of J.M. Barrie 's Peter Pan .	disgust	moviereview
18258	7772_1	 although , it 's unfortunate for the viewer that the thoughts and reflections coming through are torpid and banal  	disgust	moviereview
18281	7772_2	 Samira Makhmalbaf 's new film Blackboards is much like the ethos of a stream of consciousness , 	disgust	moviereview
4231	7773_1	... routine , harmless diversion and little else .	disgust	moviereview
4232	7774_1	Late Marriage 's stiffness is unlikely to demonstrate the emotional clout to sweep U.S. viewers off their feet .	disgust	moviereview
23810	7775_1	  This time Mr. Burns is trying something in the Martin Scorsese street-realist mode , 	disgust	moviereview
23811	7775_2	  but his self-regarding sentimentality trips him up again . 	disgust	moviereview
18303	7776_1	 While there 's something intrinsically funny about Sir Anthony Hopkins saying ` Get in the car , bitch , 	joy	moviereview
18325	7776_2	 ' this Jerry Bruckheimer production has little else to offer  	disgust	moviereview

4233	7778_1	Let 's hope -- shall we ?	anticipation	moviereview
18387	7779_1	 by which All the Queen 's Men is allegedly `` inspired '' was a lot funnier and more deftly enacted than what 's been cobbled together onscreen  	disgust	moviereview

7528	777_1	 loves horses  	joy	moviereview
7529	777_2	 The film is an enjoyable family film -- pretty much aimed at any youngster who 	joy	moviereview

20975	7780_2	  and daughters featured in this film ? 	disgust	moviereview
4234	7781_1	I do n't think so .	noemotion	moviereview
23812	7782_1	  Nothing wrong with performances here , 	joy	moviereview
23813	7782_2	  but the whiney characters bugged me . 	disgust	moviereview
18429	7783_1	 though I like the creepy ideas  	disgust	moviereview
18451	7783_2	 There is very little dread or apprehension , and 	disgust	moviereview
18472	7783_3	 , they are not executed with anything more than perfunctory skill .  	disgust	moviereview
18493	7784_1	 If you 've ever entertained the notion of doing what the title of this film implies , what Sex With Strangers actually shows  	disgust	moviereview
13065	7784_2	 may put you off the idea forever .  	disgust	moviereview
1944	7785_1	In the end , the movie collapses on its shaky foundation despite the best efforts of director Joe Carnahan .	disgust	moviereview
13088	7786_1	 the movie were less simplistic , obvious , clumsily plotted and shallowly characterized  	disgust	moviereview

1326	7787_1	But what are adults doing in the theater at all ?	disgust	moviereview
20976	7788_1	  Sticky sweet sentimentality , clumsy plotting 	disgust	moviereview
20977	7788_2	  and a rosily myopic view of life in the WWII-era Mississippi Delta undermine this adaptation . 	disgust	moviereview
20978	7789_1	  It 's another stale , kill-by-numbers flick , complete with blade-thin characters 	disgust	moviereview
20979	7789_2	  and terrible , pun-laden dialogue . 	disgust	moviereview
25664	778_2	 A frisky and fresh romantic comedy exporing sexual politics 	joy	moviereview
25665	778_3	  and the challenges of friendships between women . 	joy	moviereview
1945	7790_1	Every time you look , Sweet Home Alabama is taking another bummer of a wrong turn .	disgust	moviereview
13132	7791_1	 that it is made up of three episodes of a rejected TV show  	disgust	moviereview
13155	7791_2	 Partway through watching this saccharine , Easter-egg-colored concoction , you realize 	disgust	moviereview
1946	7792_1	The overall effect is less like a children 's movie than a recruitment film for future Hollywood sellouts .	disgust	moviereview
8427	7793_1	Portentous and pretentious , The Weight of Water is appropriately titled , given the heavy-handedness of it drama .	disgust	moviereview
13177	7794_1	 that , if nothing else , will appeal to fans of Malcolm in the Middle and its pubescent star , Frankie Muniz  	joy	moviereview
13200	7794_2	 A fitfully amusing romp 	joy	moviereview
20980	7795_1	  Jason X is positively anti-Darwinian : nine sequels 	joy	moviereview
20981	7795_2	  and 400 years later , the teens are none the wiser 	disgust	moviereview
20982	7795_3	  and Jason still kills on auto-pilot . 	joy	moviereview
13221	7796_1	 this was done better in Wilder 's Some Like It Hot is like saying the sun  	disgust	moviereview

24881	7798_1	  The actors are appealing , 	joy	moviereview
24882	7798_2	  but Elysian Fields is idiotic 	disgust	moviereview
24883	7798_3	  and absurdly sentimental . 	disgust	moviereview
20983	7799_1	  As ` chick flicks ' go , this one is pretty miserable , resorting to string-pulling rather than legitimate character development 	disgust	moviereview
20984	7799_2	  and intelligent plotting . 	joy	moviereview
8292	779_1	It 's a good film -- not a classic , but odd , entertaining and authentic .	joy	moviereview
6888	77_1	 A truly moving experience , and a perfect example of how art 	joy	moviereview
6889	77_2	 when done right 	joy	moviereview
6890	77_3	 can help heal , clarify , and comfort 	joy	moviereview

13396	7800_2	 The only excitement comes 	disgust	moviereview
4235	7801_1	There 's no emotional pulse to Solaris .	disgust	moviereview
1947	7802_1	With an emotional sterility to match its outer space setting , Soderbergh 's spectacular swing for the fence yields only a spectacular whiff .	disgust	moviereview
13416	7803_1	 if it wants to be a mystery/thriller , a romance or a comedy  	noemotion	moviereview
13438	7803_2	 It ca n't decide 	disgust	moviereview
23814	7804_1	  Denis O'Neill 's script avoids the prime sports cliche , a last-second goal to win the championship , 	joy	moviereview
23815	7804_2	  but it neglects few others . 	disgust	moviereview
1948	7805_1	The character of ZigZag is not sufficiently developed to support a film constructed around him .	disgust	moviereview
13458	7806_1	 whose promising , if rather precious , premise is undercut by amateurish execution  	disgust	moviereview
13480	7806_2	 One of those pictures 	disgust	moviereview
1949	7807_1	Serving Sara does n't serve up a whole lot of laughs .	disgust	moviereview
1950	7808_1	The most hopelessly monotonous film of the year , noteworthy only for the gimmick of being filmed as a single unbroken 87-minute take .	disgust	moviereview
4236	7809_1	With virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , Chelsea Walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge .	disgust	moviereview
7530	780_1	 Flavorful and romantic , you could call this How Martha Got Her Groove Back -- assuming  	joy	moviereview
7531	780_2	 that is , she ever had one to begin with . 	noemotion	moviereview
20985	7810_1	  Deadeningly dull , mired in convoluted melodrama , nonsensical jargon 	disgust	moviereview
20986	7810_2	  and stiff-upper-lip laboriousness . 	disgust	moviereview
13502	7811_1	 that attempts to pass itself off as hip , young adult entertainment  	disgust	moviereview
13523	7811_2	 A misogynistic piece of filth 	disgust	moviereview
4237	7812_1	Like the Chelsea 's denizens ... Burdette 's collage-form scenario tends to over-romanticize the spiritual desolation of the struggling artiste .	disgust	moviereview
1951	7813_1	It 's basically an overlong episode of Tales from the Crypt .	disgust	moviereview
13543	7814_1	 whose only apparent virtue is that he is not quite as unpleasant as some of the people in his life  	disgust	moviereview
13566	7814_2	 The film makes a fatal mistake : It asks us to care about a young man 	disgust	moviereview
13586	7815_1	 who have never sung those blues  	disgust	moviereview
13609	7815_2	 Another in-your-face wallow in the lower depths made by people 	disgust	moviereview

13673	7817_1	 that makes you want to like it  	joy	moviereview
13693	7817_2	 I ca n't quite recommend it -- it 's too patched together -- but I almost can ; it 's the kind of movie 	disgust	moviereview
1952	7818_1	Complete lack of originality , cleverness or even visible effort	disgust	moviereview
13714	7819_1	 Though Perry and Hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by Jay Scherick and David Ronn  	disgust	moviereview
13735	7819_2	 , neither the actors nor director Reginald Hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining .  	disgust	moviereview
7532	781_1	 no human screenwriter could have hoped to match  	joy	moviereview
7533	781_2	 Happily for Mr. Chin -- though unhappily for his subjects -- the invisible hand of the marketplace wrote a script that 	joy	moviereview
13753	7820_1	 that it seems to take itself far more seriously  	disgust	moviereview
13775	7820_2	 Something akin to a Japanese Alice Through the Looking Glass , except 	joy	moviereview
13796	7821_1	 who ever lived  	disgust	moviereview
13818	7821_2	 It takes talent to make a lifeless movie about the most heinous man 	disgust	moviereview
20987	7822_1	  On the whole , the movie lacks wit , feeling 	disgust	moviereview
20988	7822_2	  and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality .	disgust	moviereview
13840	7823_1	 that you 're watching a soap opera rather than a chronicle of the ups and downs that accompany lifelong friendships  	disgust	moviereview
13863	7823_2	 The story and the friendship proceeds in such a way 	noemotion	moviereview
20989	7824_1	  Offers very little genuine romance 	disgust	moviereview
20990	7824_2	  and even fewer laughs ... a sad sitcom of a movie , largely devoid of charm . 	disgust	moviereview
1953	7825_1	Makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience .	disgust	moviereview
4238	7826_1	The movie fails to live up to the sum of its parts .	disgust	moviereview
13885	7827_1	 Although Huppert 's intensity and focus has a raw exhilaration about it  	joy	moviereview
13907	7827_2	 , The Piano Teacher is anything but fun .  	disgust	moviereview
24884	7828_1	  It showcases Carvey 's talent for voices , 	joy	moviereview
24885	7828_2	  but not nearly enough 	disgust	moviereview
24886	7828_3	  and not without taxing every drop of one 's patience to get to the good stuff . 	disgust	moviereview
1954	7829_1	Bad .	disgust	moviereview
25666	782_1	  Thurman 	joy	moviereview

1955	7830_1	Very bad .	disgust	moviereview
1956	7831_1	Stultifyingly , dumbfoundingly , mind-numbingly bad .	disgust	moviereview
23816	7832_1	  May reawaken discussion of the Kennedy assassination 	disgust	moviereview
23817	7832_2	  but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen . 	disgust	moviereview
1957	7833_1	If looking for a thrilling sci-fi cinematic ride , do n't settle for this Imposter .	disgust	moviereview
13926	7834_1	 like we need doomsday thrillers  	noemotion	moviereview
13948	7834_2	 Not really bad so much as distasteful : We need kidnapping suspense dramas right now 	disgust	moviereview
13969	7835_1	 that died  	noemotion	moviereview
13991	7835_2	 The result is a gaudy bag of stale candy , something from a Halloween 	disgust	moviereview

16417	8179_1	 As conceived by Mr. Schaeffer  	noemotion	moviereview

16461	8180_1	 that it chokes the energy right out of the very audience it seeks to frighten  	disgust	moviereview
16483	8180_2	 Like so many other allegedly scary movies , it gets so tangled up in The Twist 	disgust	moviereview

21103	8189_1	  Though a bit of a patchwork in script 	noemotion	moviereview

17002	8194_2	 The premise is in extremely bad taste , and the film 's supposed insights are so poorly thought-out and substance-free 	disgust	moviereview
23844	8195_1	  Sets up a nice concept for its fiftysomething leading ladies , 	disgust	moviereview
23845	8195_2	  but fails loudly in execution . 	disgust	moviereview
17023	8196_1	 that 's worth watching in Birthday Girl , a film by the stage-trained Jez Butterworth -LRB- Mojo -RRB- that serves as yet another example of the sad decline of British comedies in the post-Full Monty world  	disgust	moviereview
17044	8196_2	 Kidman is really the only thing 	disgust	moviereview

2016	8198_1	This time Kaufman 's imagination has failed him .	disgust	moviereview
23846	8199_1	  An intermittently pleasing 	joy	moviereview
23847	8199_2	  but mostly routine effort . 	disgust	moviereview
3650	819_1	The 3D images only enhance the film 's otherworldly quality , giving it a strange combo of you-are-there closeness with the disorienting unreality of the seemingly broken-down fourth wall of the movie screen .	joy	moviereview

4276	8200_1	It becomes gimmicky instead of compelling .	disgust	moviereview

2017	8208_1	Sluggishly directed by episodic TV veteran Joe Zwick , it 's a sitcom without the snap-crackle .	disgust	moviereview

4278	8213_1	The thrill is -LRB- long -RRB- gone .	disgust	moviereview
4279	8214_1	Began life as a computer game , then morphed into a movie -- a bad one , of course .	disgust	moviereview
24915	8215_1	  Part comedy , part drama , the movie winds up accomplishing neither in full , 	disgust	moviereview
24916	8215_2	  and leaves us feeling touched 	joy	moviereview

2019	8216_1	Godawful boring slug of a movie .	disgust	moviereview
23848	8217_1	  Dull , if not devoid of wit , this shaggy dog longs to frisk through the back alleys of history , 	disgust	moviereview

23850	8218_1	  Scene-by-scene , things happen , 	disgust	moviereview
23851	8218_2	  but you 'd be hard-pressed to say what or why . 	disgust	moviereview
2020	8219_1	... an unimaginative , nasty , glibly cynical piece of work .	disgust	moviereview
24365	821_1	  It 's predictable , 	disgust	moviereview
24366	821_2	  but it jumps through the expected hoops with style 	joy	moviereview
24367	821_3	  and even some depth . 	joy	moviereview
23852	8220_1	  It is , by conventional standards , a fairly terrible movie ... 	disgust	moviereview
23853	8220_2	  but it is also weirdly fascinating , a ready-made Eurotrash cult object . 	joy	moviereview
932	8221_1	It is also , at times , curiously moving .	joy	moviereview
21116	8222_1	  The tug-of-war at the core of Beijing Bicycle becomes weighed down with agonizing contrivances , overheated pathos 	disgust	moviereview

17436	8227_1	 Offensive in the way 	disgust	moviereview
17458	8227_2	 it exploits the hot-button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills 	disgust	moviereview

21118	8228_1	  Mark me down as a non-believer in werewolf films that are not serious 	disgust	moviereview

17556	8231_1	 if your film becomes boring , and your dialogue is n't smart  	disgust	moviereview
17578	8231_2	 Accuracy and realism are terrific , but 	disgust	moviereview
17599	8231_3	 , then you need to use more poetic license .  	disgust	moviereview
21122	8232_1	  For all its highfalutin title 	disgust	moviereview
21123	8232_2	  and corkscrew narrative , the movie turns out to be not much more than a shaggy human tale . 	disgust	moviereview
17621	8233_1	 that ends up being even dumber than its title  	disgust	moviereview
17642	8233_2	 A soggy , cliche-bound epic-horror yarn 	disgust	moviereview
2023	8234_1	One groan-inducing familiarity begets another .	disgust	moviereview
17664	8235_1	 Although based on a real-life person  	disgust	moviereview
17686	8235_2	 , John , in the movie , is a rather dull person to be stuck with for two hours .  	disgust	moviereview
2024	8236_1	Great story , bad idea for a movie .	disgust	moviereview
17709	8237_1	 that feels like a sugar high gone awry  	disgust	moviereview

21124	8238_1	  There is no entry portal in The Rules of Attraction , 	disgust	moviereview

17771	8239_2	 It 's hard to tell with all the crashing and banging 	disgust	moviereview

23856	8253_1	  Spousal abuse is a major problem in contemporary society , 	disgust	moviereview

13399	8515_3	 Newcomer helmer Kevin Donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of 	disgust	moviereview
13419	8515_4	 -- a high-tech tux 	noemotion	moviereview
13440	8516_1	 because there 's not an original character , siuation or joke in the entire movie  	disgust	moviereview
13461	8516_2	 Should n't have been allowed to use the word `` new '' in its title , 	disgust	moviereview
24935	8517_1	  Often silly -- 	joy	moviereview
24936	8517_2	  and gross -- 	disgust	moviereview
24937	8517_3	  but it 's rarely as moronic as some campus gross-out films . 	disgust	moviereview
13483	8518_1	 that it can be made on the cheap  	joy	moviereview
13505	8518_2	 The advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is 	joy	moviereview

7597	851_1	 Hawke draws out the best from his large cast in beautifully articulated portrayals  	joy	moviereview

2076	8520_1	Reign of Fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap .	disgust	moviereview
13526	8521_1	 that the audience laughs out loud  	disgust	moviereview
13546	8521_2	 The performances are so leaden , Michael Rymer 's direction is so bloodless and the dialogue is so corny 	disgust	moviereview
13569	8522_1	 in which our purported heroine pathologically avenges a hatred for men  	anger	moviereview

13612	8525_1	 If somebody was bored and ... decided to make a dull , pretentious version of Jesus ' Son  	disgust	moviereview

13655	8526_1	 when considering some of the other dreck out there right now  	disgust	moviereview
13676	8526_2	 The best you can say about it is 	disgust	moviereview

13756	8527_2	 A tough go , but Leigh 's depth and rigor , and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals 	joy	moviereview
2078	8528_1	An overstuffed compendium of teen-Catholic-movie dogma .	disgust	moviereview
21211	8529_1	  Too leisurely paced 	disgust	moviereview
21212	8529_2	  and visually drab for its own good , it succeeds in being only sporadically amusing . 	disgust	moviereview

21213	8535_1	  The movie 's biggest offense is its complete 	disgust	moviereview
21214	8535_2	  and utter lack of tension . 	disgust	moviereview
21215	8536_1	  The film is directed by Wally Wolodarsky from a script by Joe Jarvis 	noemotion	moviereview

13910	8541_1	 Though Avary has done his best to make something out of Ellis ' nothing novel , in the end  	disgust	moviereview

21217	8542_1	  The average local news columnist has a bigger rant on the war between modern landscape architecture 	disgust	moviereview

14016	8544_1	 that viewers are likely to lose interest before Sandrine  	disgust	moviereview
14039	8544_2	 The plot is so predictable and sentimental 	disgust	moviereview
14060	8544_3	 and her goats walk off into the sunset .  	disgust	moviereview
14080	8545_1	 as the film goes on  	noemotion	moviereview
14102	8545_2	 At first , the sight of a blind man directing a film is hilarious , but 	disgust	moviereview
14125	8545_3	 , the joke wears thin .  	disgust	moviereview
21219	8546_1	  Never Again swings between false sentiment 	disgust	moviereview
21220	8546_2	  and unfunny madcap comedy 	disgust	moviereview
21221	8546_3	  and , along the way , expects the audience to invest in the central relationship as some kind of marriage of true minds . 	disgust	moviereview
14148	8547_1	 itself is uninteresting , and the songs are painfully undistinguished : They Might Be Giants ' So to Be One of Us may be the most tuneless tune  	disgust	moviereview
14170	8547_2	 the story 	disgust	moviereview
14191	8547_3	 ever composed .  	disgust	moviereview

14234	8549_2	 The title 's lameness should clue you in on 	disgust	moviereview
25692	854_1	  It turns out to be a cut above the norm , thanks to some clever writing 	joy	moviereview
25693	854_2	  and sprightly acting . 	joy	moviereview
4315	8550_1	The parts are better than the whole -LRB- bizarre , funny , tragic - like love in New York -RRB- .	joy	moviereview
14256	8551_1	 that is just as simplistic as a Hollywood production  	disgust	moviereview
14278	8551_2	 While the film shuns the glamour or glitz that an American movie might demand  	disgust	moviereview
14299	8551_3	 , Scherfig tosses us a romantic scenario 	disgust	moviereview
14319	8552_1	 that knees in the crotch , elbows in the face and spit in the eye are inherently funny  	disgust	moviereview
14342	8552_2	 The humor is hinged on the belief 	disgust	moviereview
2081	8553_1	It 's a movie forged in the fires of Chick Flick Hell .	disgust	moviereview
2082	8554_1	Its characters are thinner than cardboard -- or even comic-book paper .	disgust	moviereview
2083	8555_1	Any one episode of The Sopranos would send this ill-conceived folly to sleep with the fishes .	disgust	moviereview
14364	8556_1	 that was ever made for the Lifetime cable television network  	disgust	moviereview
14386	8556_2	 Feels like the grittiest movie 	joy	moviereview
14406	8557_1	 she must be a failure at life , because she 's driven by ambition and Does n't Know How to Have Fun  	disgust	moviereview
14429	8557_2	 Lanie 's professional success means 	noemotion	moviereview
14450	8558_1	 than it deserves  	joy	moviereview
14473	8558_2	 Credit must be given to Harland Williams , Michael Rosenbaum and Barry Watson , who inject far more good-natured spirit and talent into this project 	joy	moviereview
4316	8559_1	Denzel Washington 's efforts are sunk by all the sanctimony .	disgust	moviereview
23248	855_1	  You might not want to hang out with Samantha , 	disgust	moviereview
23249	855_2	  but you 'll probably see a bit of yourself in her unfinished story . 	joy	moviereview
14494	8560_1	 If this holiday movie is supposed to be a gift  	noemotion	moviereview
14516	8560_2	 , somebody unwrapped it early , took out all the good stuff , and left behind the crap -LRB- literally -RRB- .  	disgust	moviereview
14536	8561_1	 as to have viewers recoiling from the reality check  	disgust	moviereview
14558	8561_2	 So faithful to the doldrums of the not-quite-urban , not-quite-suburban milieu 	disgust	moviereview
2084	8562_1	Rambles on in a disjointed , substandard fashion from one poorly executed action sequence to the next .	disgust	moviereview
24938	8563_1	  There 's an audience for it , 	noemotion	moviereview
24939	8563_2	  but it could have been funnier 	disgust	moviereview
24940	8563_3	  and more innocent . 	disgust	moviereview
21222	8564_1	  I can only imagine one thing worse than Kevin Spacey trying on an Irish accent , 	disgust	moviereview
21223	8564_2	  and that 's sultry Linda Fiorentino doing the same thing . 	noemotion	moviereview
21224	8565_1	  An awkward 	disgust	moviereview
21225	8565_2	  and indigestible movie . 	disgust	moviereview
2085	8566_1	The movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs .	disgust	moviereview
4317	8567_1	Haneke keeps us at arm 's length .	noemotion	moviereview
2086	8568_1	Guided more by intellect than heart , his story flattens instead of sharpens .	disgust	moviereview
14577	8569_1	 that The Believer feels like a 12-Step Program for the Jewish Nazi  	disgust	moviereview
14598	8569_2	 All the well-meaningness in the world ca n't erase the fact 	disgust	moviereview
25694	856_1	  A work of intricate elegance , literary lyricism 	joy	moviereview
25695	856_2	  and profound common sense . 	joy	moviereview
14619	8570_1	 what worked last time , repeats it and adds more characters , more stunts , more stuff in attempt to camouflage its sameness  	disgust	moviereview
14642	8570_2	 Like most sequels , it takes 	disgust	moviereview
14664	8571_1	 where it all went wrong  	disgust	moviereview
14687	8571_2	 There 's no way to sort out the mess in our heads and deconstruct 	disgust	moviereview
21226	8572_1	  This is an hour 	noemotion	moviereview
21227	8572_2	  and a half of daydreaming . 	joy	moviereview
2920	8573_1	Message movie or an action-packed submarine spectacular ?	noemotion	moviereview
2921	8574_1	Alas , it 's neither .	sadness	moviereview
2087	8575_1	No movement , no yuks , not much of anything .	disgust	moviereview
14708	8576_1	 that turns into a film wreck  	disgust	moviereview
14729	8576_2	 ` Dragonfly ' is a movie about a bus wreck 	disgust	moviereview
2922	8577_1	Thirty years ago , it would have been groundbreaking .	disgust	moviereview
2088	8578_1	Now it 's just tired .	disgust	moviereview
2089	8579_1	Heavy-handed exercise in time-vaulting literary pretension .	disgust	moviereview
7604	857_1	 we 'll ever come to looking through a photographer 's viewfinder as he works  	noemotion	moviereview
7605	857_2	 It 's as close as 	joy	moviereview
14749	8580_1	 like it was made by some very stoned college students  	disgust	moviereview
14771	8580_2	 The movie is too cute to take itself too seriously , but it still feels 	disgust	moviereview
2090	8581_1	A thinly veiled excuse for Wilson to play his self-deprecating act against Murphy 's well-honed prima donna shtick .	disgust	moviereview
21228	8582_1	  A minor picture with a major identity crisis -- it 's sort of true 	disgust	moviereview
21229	8582_2	  and it 's sort of bogus 	disgust	moviereview
21230	8582_3	  and it 's ho-hum all the way through . 	disgust	moviereview
4318	8583_1	The movie succumbs to being nothing more than a formulaic chase in the dark .	disgust	moviereview
23882	8584_1	  Plays as hollow catharsis , with lots of tears 	disgust	moviereview
23883	8584_2	  but very little in the way of insights . 	disgust	moviereview
14793	8585_1	 that the movie is n't scary  	disgust	moviereview
14815	8585_2	 It will come as no surprise 	disgust	moviereview
2091	8586_1	But here 's the real damn : It is n't funny , either .	disgust	moviereview
14836	8587_1	 who wants to see a comedy about shoddy airport security  	disgust	moviereview
14856	8587_2	 Quick : 	noemotion	moviereview
14878	8588_1	 which is immaculately produced  	disgust	moviereview
14897	8588_2	 that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory  	disgust	moviereview
14919	8588_3	 The reason I found myself finally unmoved by this film , 	disgust	moviereview
14939	8588_4	 and has serious things to say , is 	disgust	moviereview
14959	8589_1	 What you get with Empire  	noemotion	moviereview
14979	8589_2	 you 've seen many times before , repackaged as new material because there is a Latino in the lead  	disgust	moviereview
14999	8589_3	 is a movie 	disgust	moviereview
116	858_1	Thoughtful , provocative and entertaining .	joy	moviereview
15021	8590_1	 that -- on the basis of this film alone -- I 'm not one of them  	joy	moviereview
15040	8590_2	 Cho 's fans are sure to be entertained ; it 's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say 	disgust	moviereview
15061	8591_1	 that may never have existed outside of a scriptwriter 's imagination  	disgust	moviereview
15080	8591_2	 Looks awfully like one long tourist spot for a Mississippi 	disgust	moviereview
24941	8592_1	  The period -- swinging London in the time of the mods 	disgust	moviereview
24942	8592_2	  and the rockers -- gets the once-over once again in Gangster No. 1 , 	noemotion	moviereview
24943	8592_3	  but falls apart long before the end . 	disgust	moviereview
4319	8593_1	High Crimes miscasts nearly every leading character .	disgust	moviereview
15101	8594_1	 that the Star Trek tradition has been honored as best it can  	joy	moviereview
15119	8594_2	 The overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there 's still a real sense 	disgust	moviereview
15139	8594_3	 , given the embarrassing script and weak direction .  	disgust	moviereview
15158	8595_1	 that represents nothing more than the art of the deal  	disgust	moviereview
15177	8595_2	 De Niro looks bored , Murphy recycles Murphy , and you mentally add Showtime to the pile of Hollywood dreck 	disgust	moviereview
2092	8596_1	I did n't believe for a moment in these villains or their plot .	disgust	moviereview
2923	8597_1	Another rent installment for the Ian Fleming estate .	noemotion	moviereview
15197	8598_1	 if only Benigni had n't insisted on casting himself in the title role  	disgust	moviereview
15218	8598_2	 With Danilo Donati 's witty designs and Dante Spinotti 's luscious cinematography , this might have made a decent children 's movie -- 	disgust	moviereview
21231	8599_1	  So lazy 	disgust	moviereview
21232	8599_2	  and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft-core imagery with naughty fun . 	disgust	moviereview
25696	859_1	  Witty , touching 	joy	moviereview
25697	859_2	  and well paced . 	joy	moviereview
3571	85_1	Haneke challenges us to confront the reality of sexual aberration .	joy	moviereview
15238	8600_1	 Though it draws several decent laughs  	disgust	moviereview
15260	8600_2	 , it 's low-cal Woody at best .  	disgust	moviereview
2093	8601_1	Has little on its mind aside from scoring points with drag gags .	disgust	moviereview
934	8602_1	Britney 's performance can not be faulted .	joy	moviereview
2094	8603_1	Lucy 's a dull girl , that 's all .	disgust	moviereview
23884	8604_1	  Well-shot 	joy	moviereview
23885	8604_2	  but badly written tale set in a future ravaged by dragons . 	disgust	moviereview
4320	8605_1	Sadly , Hewitt 's forte is leaning forward while wearing low-cut gowns , not making snappy comebacks .	disgust	moviereview
15281	8606_1	 If Melville is creatively a great whale  	disgust	moviereview
15302	8606_2	 , this film is canned tuna .  	disgust	moviereview
15323	8607_1	 that it 's easy to imagine that a new software program spit out the screenplay  	disgust	moviereview
15343	8607_2	 This film is so slick , superficial and trend-hoppy , 	disgust	moviereview
21233	8608_1	  Just one more collection of penis , breast 	disgust	moviereview
21234	8608_2	  and flatulence gags in search of a story . 	disgust	moviereview
2924	8609_1	Or a profit .	noemotion	moviereview
7606	860_1	 I could n't help being captivated by it  	joy	moviereview
7607	860_2	 Lee Jeong-Hyang tells it so lovingly and films it so beautifully that 	joy	moviereview
2095	8610_1	Or some damn thing .	anger	moviereview
15363	8611_1	 like they were borrowed from Gilligan 's Island  	disgust	moviereview
15384	8611_2	 The acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look 	disgust	moviereview
15406	8611_3	 -- and the CGI Scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year .  	disgust	moviereview
2096	8612_1	Enough trivializes an important crisis , reduces it to an almost comic embarrassment .	disgust	moviereview
21235	8613_1	  The makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original 	disgust	moviereview
21236	8613_2	  and , instead , rehash old jokes 	disgust	moviereview
21237	8613_3	  and leave any life at the doorstep . 	disgust	moviereview
935	8614_1	I like Frank the Pug , though .	joy	moviereview
15426	8615_1	 though if ever a movie needed one of the actor 's whiny jags to pump it up , this has to be among the rare ones  	disgust	moviereview
15448	8615_2	 A restrained Ribisi convinces as an Italian , 	joy	moviereview
4321	8616_1	Gee , a second assassin shot Kennedy ?	disgust	moviereview
2925	8617_1	Moot point .	noemotion	moviereview
21238	8618_1	  A hysterical yet humorless disquisition on the thin line between sucking face 	disgust	moviereview
21239	8618_2	  and literally sucking face . 	disgust	moviereview
15468	8619_1	 that follow  	disgust	moviereview
15490	8619_2	 Needless to say , the dramatics 	noemotion	moviereview
15510	8619_3	 are utter hooey .  	disgust	moviereview
23250	861_1	  You have to pay attention to follow all the stories , 	joy	moviereview
23251	861_2	  but they 're each interesting . 	joy	moviereview
15532	8620_1	 that rather than dramatizing this premise , Mr. Desplechin is content to state it  	disgust	moviereview
15552	8620_2	 The problem is 	noemotion	moviereview
2097	8621_1	Madonna still ca n't act a lick .	disgust	moviereview
15593	8622_2	 which is a simple retread of the 1979 Alien , with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship  	disgust	moviereview
15611	8622_3	 Even the imaginative gore 	noemotion	moviereview

2098	8628_1	Do n't let your festive spirit go this far .	disgust	moviereview
15781	8629_1	 Though the book runs only about 300 pages  	disgust	moviereview
15804	8629_2	 it is so densely packed ... that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like Mr. Schepisi 's seems skimpy and unclear  	disgust	moviereview
25698	862_1	  The movie is well shot 	joy	moviereview
25699	862_2	  and very tragic , 	joy	moviereview

15954	8633_4	 , skates blithely from one implausible situation to another , pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows 	disgust	moviereview
2100	8634_1	... perhaps the heaviest , most joyless movie ever made about giant dragons taking over the world .	disgust	moviereview
24944	8635_1	  Suggests puns about ingredients 	disgust	moviereview

1458	8636_1	I 'd give real money to see the perpetrators of Chicago torn apart by dingoes .	disgust	moviereview
937	8637_1	Movies like this are selling the old European candor , the old wink of ` bold ' revelation .	joy	moviereview

16039	8640_2	 I admire it and yet can not recommend it , 	disgust	moviereview
21240	8641_1	  A fairly by-the-books blend of action 	disgust	moviereview
21241	8641_2	  and romance with sprinklings of intentional 	joy	moviereview
21242	8641_3	  and unintentional comedy . 	disgust	moviereview
16062	8642_1	 that no two people working on the production had exactly the same thing in mind  	disgust	moviereview

2101	8644_1	The story bogs down in a mess of purposeless violence .	disgust	moviereview
938	8645_1	Despite some gulps the film is a fuzzy huggy .	joy	moviereview
21243	8646_1	  McKay deflates his piece of puffery with a sour cliche 	disgust	moviereview
21244	8646_2	  and heavy doses of mean-spiritedness 	disgust	moviereview
21245	8647_1	  A recipe for cinematic disaster ... part Quentin Tarantino , part Guy Ritchie , 	disgust	moviereview
21246	8647_2	  and part 1960s spy spoof , it 's all bad . 	disgust	moviereview
2102	8648_1	The cumulative effect of the relentless horror on parade numbs the movie 's power as a work of drama .	disgust	moviereview
2103	8649_1	Another big , dumb action movie in the vein of XXX , The Transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black BMW through .	disgust	moviereview
25701	864_1	  A map of the inner rhythms of love and jealousy 	joy	moviereview
25702	864_3	  and sacrifice drawn with a master 's steady stroke . 	joy	moviereview
4325	8650_1	Aaliyah rarely dampens her diva persona enough to spark genuine chemistry with Townsend .	disgust	moviereview

16291	8654_1	 Much of what is meant to be ` inspirational ' and ` uplifting '  	disgust	moviereview
16333	8654_3	 is simply distasteful to audiences not already sharing -LRB- the movie 's -RRB- mindset .  	disgust	moviereview

16377	8655_2	 , Beijing Bicycle begins spinning its wheels .  	joy	moviereview

21251	8663_1	  Abandons all pretense of creating historical context 	disgust	moviereview
21252	8663_2	  and waltzes off into a hectic soap about the ups 	disgust	moviereview
21253	8663_3	  and downs of the heavy breathing between the two artists . 	disgust	moviereview
2104	8664_1	Even die-hard fans of Japanese animation ... will find this one a challenge .	disgust	moviereview
2105	8665_1	Filmmakers have to dig deep to sink this low .	disgust	moviereview
2106	8666_1	Fortunately for all involved , this movie is likely to disappear as quickly as an ice cube thrown into a pot of boiling water .	disgust	moviereview
4327	8667_1	The movie gets muted and routine .	disgust	moviereview
4328	8668_1	The issue of faith is not explored very deeply	disgust	moviereview
16620	8669_1	 how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest  	disgust	moviereview
16641	8669_2	 when you 're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects ' deaths just so the documentary will be over  	disgust	moviereview
16663	8669_3	 It 's a bad sign 	disgust	moviereview

7610	866_1	 Grant gets to display his cadness to perfection ,  	joy	moviereview
7611	866_2	 but also to show acting range 	joy	moviereview

16708	8670_1	 the boys take in their high heels  	disgust	moviereview
16731	8670_2	 The situations and jokes are as predictable and as lowbrow as the endless pratfalls 	disgust	moviereview
16752	8671_1	 they probably thought were funniest when they were high  	disgust	moviereview
16774	8671_2	 who are obviously pretty clever  	disgust	moviereview
16795	8671_3	 It 's frustrating to see these guys -- 	disgust	moviereview
16816	8671_4	 -- waste their talent on parodies of things 	disgust	moviereview
2107	8672_1	I was perplexed to watch it unfold with an astonishing lack of passion or uniqueness .	disgust	moviereview
16837	8673_1	 when it turns into an elegiacally soggy Saving Private Ryanovich  	disgust	moviereview
16858	8673_2	 K-19 may not hold a lot of water as a submarine epic , but it holds even less 	disgust	moviereview
23886	8674_1	  A very stylish 	disgust	moviereview
23887	8674_2	  but ultimately extremely silly tale ... a slick piece of nonsense 	disgust	moviereview
23888	8674_3	  but nothing more . 	disgust	moviereview
2108	8675_1	Automatically pegs itself for the straight-to-video sci-fi rental shelf .	disgust	moviereview
16880	8676_1	 that never take off  	disgust	moviereview
16900	8676_2	 The film is like a series of beginnings and middles 	disgust	moviereview

16941	8677_2	 Feels less like it 's about teenagers  	disgust	moviereview
8438	8678_1	Ja Rule and Kurupt should have gotten to rap .	anger	moviereview

4331	8683_1	In the end , White Oleander is n't an adaptation of a novel .	disgust	moviereview
2109	8684_1	It 's a flashy , star-splashed reduction .	disgust	moviereview
21254	8685_1	  This film , starring Anthony Hopkins 	disgust	moviereview

2113	8691_1	Men in Black II has sequel-itis something fierce .	joy	moviereview
2114	8692_1	An ungainly , comedy-deficient , B-movie rush job ...	disgust	moviereview
17111	8693_1	 that do little to disguise the fact that the characters barely move  	disgust	moviereview
17134	8693_2	 A combination of standard , stiff TV-style animation and snazzy-looking digital effects 	disgust	moviereview
17156	8694_1	 where the most conservative protagonist is always the last one living  	disgust	moviereview
17178	8694_2	 An unsatisfying hybrid of Blair Witch and typical stalk-and-slash fare , 	disgust	moviereview

8439	8699_1	Maudlin and melodramatic we expected .	disgust	moviereview
3653	869_1	Harsh , effective documentary on life in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories .	joy	moviereview
6900	86_1	 a little clarity would have gone a long way  	noemotion	moviereview
6901	86_2	 Absorbing and disturbing -- perhaps more disturbing than originally intended -- but 	disgust	moviereview
4335	8700_1	Boring we did n't .	disgust	moviereview
21256	8701_1	  Never quite transcends jokester status ... 	disgust	moviereview

17244	8702_1	 what could have been a more multifaceted look at this interesting time and place  	disgust	moviereview
17266	8702_2	 The film 's bathos often overwhelms 	disgust	moviereview
8440	8703_1	It almost plays like Solaris , but with guns and jokes .	disgust	moviereview
21258	8704_1	  A baffling misfire , 	disgust	moviereview
21259	8704_2	  and possibly the weakest movie -LRB- Woody Allen -RRB- has made in the last twenty years . 	disgust	moviereview

17349	8706_2	 This film looks 	noemotion	moviereview
23889	8707_1	  Propelled not by characters 	noemotion	moviereview
23890	8707_2	  but by caricatures . 	disgust	moviereview
2116	8708_1	There is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production .	anger	moviereview
23891	8709_1	  This extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , 	disgust	moviereview
23892	8709_2	  but feels twice as long . 	disgust	moviereview
24368	870_1	  The film is all a little Lit Crit 101 , 	disgust	moviereview
24369	870_2	  but it 's extremely well played 	joy	moviereview
24370	870_3	  and often very funny . 	joy	moviereview
17372	8710_1	 that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast  	joy	moviereview
17394	8710_2	 Earnest but earthbound ... a slow , soggy , soporific , visually dank crime melodrama/character study 	joy	moviereview
17416	8711_1	 the film ca n't help but go soft and stinky  	disgust	moviereview
17438	8711_2	 The pivotal narrative point is so ripe 	disgust	moviereview
17460	8712_1	 while brandishing a new action hero  	disgust	moviereview
17482	8712_2	 For all its alleged youthful fire , XXX is no less subservient to Bond 's tired formula of guns , girls and gadgets 	disgust	moviereview
21260	8713_1	  A predictable 	disgust	moviereview
21261	8713_2	  and stereotypical little B-movie . 	disgust	moviereview
17501	8714_1	 If I Spy were funny -LRB- enough -RRB- or exciting -LRB- enough -RRB-  	disgust	moviereview
17519	8714_2	 then it would be fairly simple to forgive the financial extortion it 's trying to reap from the moviegoing public .  	disgust	moviereview

17558	8715_2	 Frustratingly , Dridi tells us nothing about El Gallo other than 	disgust	moviereview
21262	8716_1	  Places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , 	disgust	moviereview
21263	8716_2	  and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller . 	disgust	moviereview
17580	8717_1	 when it 's really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type  	joy	moviereview
17601	8717_2	 Stephen Earnhart 's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition -- wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text -- 	disgust	moviereview
4336	8718_1	A very average science fiction film .	disgust	moviereview
21264	8719_1	  Undone by its overly complicated 	disgust	moviereview
21265	8719_2	  and derivative screenplay , the glacier-paced direction 	disgust	moviereview
21266	8719_3	  and the stereotypical characters . 	disgust	moviereview

17623	8720_1	 How anyone over the age of 2 can stomach the touchy-feely message this preachy produce promotes  	disgust	moviereview
17644	8720_2	 is beyond us .  	disgust	moviereview
17666	8721_1	 that gives tastelessness a bad rap  	disgust	moviereview
17688	8721_2	 The sort of movie 	disgust	moviereview
17711	8722_1	 which contains few laughs and not much drama  	disgust	moviereview
17732	8722_2	 The cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , 	disgust	moviereview
21267	8723_1	  The plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television - caliber 	disgust	moviereview
21268	8723_2	  and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy . 	disgust	moviereview
17753	8724_1	 that is heavy on religious symbols but wafer-thin  	disgust	moviereview
17773	8724_2	 ordinary melodrama 	disgust	moviereview
17796	8724_3	 on dramatic substance  	disgust	moviereview

18069	8734_2	 is genuine sweep or feeling or even a character worth caring about .  	disgust	moviereview
18092	8735_1	 While Benigni -LRB- who stars and co-wrote -RRB- seems to be having a wonderful time  	disgust	moviereview

24948	8736_1	  Yes , 4Ever is harmless in the extreme 	joy	moviereview
24949	8736_2	  and it 'll mute your kids for nearly 80 minutes , 	joy	moviereview

23899	8785_1	  This 72-minute film does have some exciting scenes , 	joy	moviereview

21287	8787_1	  A mix of velocity 	disgust	moviereview

21289	8787_3	  and the brains -- of the 1970s original . 	disgust	moviereview
21290	8788_1	  The low-budget Full Frontal was one of the year 's murkiest , intentionally obscure 	disgust	moviereview
21291	8788_2	  and self-indulgent pictures , 	disgust	moviereview

21294	8791_2	  and self-indulgent actor moments . 	disgust	moviereview
21295	8792_1	  Apallingly absurd ... the chemistry or lack thereof between Newton 	disgust	moviereview

21302	8797_1	  Despite its good nature 	disgust	moviereview

13952	8798_2	 It 's hard not to feel 	disgust	moviereview
2128	8799_1	I watched the brainless insanity of No Such Thing with mounting disbelief .	disgust	moviereview
7624	879_1	 Though the controversial Korean filmmaker 's latest effort is not for all tastes  	anticipation	moviereview

13994	8802_2	 While obviously an extremely personal work  	surprise	moviereview

2130	8804_1	Like a marathon runner trying to finish a race , you need a constant influx of liquid just to get through it .	disgust	moviereview

21307	8807_2	  and all the comedy of a Gallagher stand-up act . 	disgust	moviereview
23903	8808_1	  It does n't do the original any particular dishonor , 	disgust	moviereview
23904	8808_2	  but neither does it exude any charm or personality . 	disgust	moviereview
14103	8809_1	 it never builds any suspense  	disgust	moviereview

14192	8810_3	 mummified and thoroughly unsurprising .  	disgust	moviereview
14213	8811_1	 that 's so sloppily written and cast that you can not believe anyone more central to the creation of Bugsy than the caterer  	disgust	moviereview
14235	8811_2	 A semi-autobiographical film 	noemotion	moviereview
14257	8811_3	 had anything to do with it .  	disgust	moviereview
2131	8812_1	It feels like a community theater production of a great Broadway play : Even at its best , it will never hold a candle to the original .	disgust	moviereview
14279	8813_1	 where people in hotel hallways recite poetry in voice-over instead of speaking to each other  	disgust	moviereview

14430	8816_1	 if a movie is truly going to inspire me  	disgust	moviereview
14451	8816_2	 Maybe it 's asking too much , but 	disgust	moviereview
14474	8816_3	 , I want a little more than this .  	disgust	moviereview
2132	8817_1	A graceless , witless attempt at mating Some Like It Hot with the WWII espionage thriller .	disgust	moviereview
8443	8818_1	The story and characters are nowhere near gripping enough .	disgust	moviereview
14495	8819_1	 that writer 's usual blend of observant cleverness , too-facile coincidence and slightly noxious preciousness  	joy	moviereview
14517	8819_2	 Based on a David Leavitt story , the film shares 	noemotion	moviereview
23252	881_1	  The story may not be new , 	joy	moviereview

14559	8822_2	 National Lampoon 's Van Wilder could be the worst thing 	disgust	moviereview
14578	8823_1	 as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director John Woo has built his career on  	disgust	moviereview
14599	8823_2	 This is a great subject for a movie , but Hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it 	disgust	moviereview
4342	8824_1	Ecks this one off your must-see list .	disgust	moviereview
4343	8825_1	Overall , the film misses the brilliance of Jelinek 's novel by some way .	disgust	moviereview
2133	8826_1	It settles for being merely grim .	disgust	moviereview
24959	8827_1	  The Irwins emerge unscathed , 	joy	moviereview
24960	8827_2	  but the fictional footage is unconvincing 	disgust	moviereview
24961	8827_3	  and criminally badly acted . 	disgust	moviereview
14620	8828_1	 which drives this movie  	joy	moviereview
14643	8828_2	 It 's not thirsty , consuming passion 	disgust	moviereview
21313	8829_1	  No , it 's the repetition of said behavior , 	noemotion	moviereview
21314	8829_2	  and so Children of the Century is more mindless love than mad , more grating 	disgust	moviereview
21315	8829_3	  and boring than anything else . 	disgust	moviereview
25708	882_1	  It 's endearing to hear Madame D. refer to her husband as ` Jackie ' -- 	joy	moviereview

14665	8830_1	 Just because it really happened to you , honey ,  	disgust	moviereview
14688	8830_2	 does n't mean that it 's interesting to anyone else  	disgust	moviereview
4344	8831_1	Just like the deli sandwich : lots of ham , lots of cheese , with a sickly sweet coating to disguise its excrescence until just after -LRB- or during -RRB- consumption of its second half .	disgust	moviereview
14730	8832_1	 that confirms one 's worse fears about civilization as we know it  	disgust	moviereview

14857	8836_2	 , it would be called Beta Alpha Delta .  	disgust	moviereview
14879	8837_1	 as the subject matter would suggest , but is a little like a nature film , showing a patient predator and his foolish prey  	disgust	moviereview
14898	8837_2	 Not a cheap slasher flick , 	joy	moviereview
8444	8838_1	Uneasy mishmash of styles and genres .	disgust	moviereview
14920	8839_1	 that a strong , unified showing among Germany and Eastern European Jews might have changed 20th-Century history  	disgust	moviereview
14940	8839_2	 Herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion 	noemotion	moviereview
14960	8839_3	 is undermined by Ahola 's inadequate performance .  	disgust	moviereview
3655	883_1	The film often achieves a mesmerizing poetry .	joy	moviereview

15062	8844_2	 Myers never knows 	disgust	moviereview
15081	8844_3	 ; thus , we 're subjected to one mind-numbingly lengthy riff on poo and pee jokes after another .  	disgust	moviereview
2137	8845_1	Too lazy to take advantage of its semi-humorous premise .	disgust	moviereview
21316	8846_1	  A great ending does n't make up for a weak movie , 	disgust	moviereview
21317	8846_2	  and Crazy as Hell does n't even have a great ending . 	disgust	moviereview
21318	8847_1	  Dialogue-heavy 	disgust	moviereview
21319	8847_2	  and too cerebral for its own good -- or , at any rate , too cerebral for its racy subject matter . 	disgust	moviereview
15102	8848_1	 it otherwise develops  	noemotion	moviereview
15120	8848_2	 Its over-reliance on genre conventions , character types and formulaic conflict resolutions crushes all the goodwill 	disgust	moviereview
4347	8849_1	As an actor , The Rock is aptly named .	disgust	moviereview
3656	884_1	More than makes up for its mawkish posing by offering rousing spates of genuine feeling .	joy	moviereview
2138	8850_1	A mostly tired retread of several other mob tales .	disgust	moviereview
15140	8851_1	 I was glad when it was over  	joy	moviereview
15159	8851_2	 I could say `` Thank God It 's Friday ''  	other	moviereview
15178	8851_3	 I wish 	anticipation	moviereview
15198	8851_4	 , but the truth of the matter is 	noemotion	moviereview
2139	8852_1	Nothing about it fits .	disgust	moviereview
15219	8853_1	 As it abruptly crosscuts among the five friends  	noemotion	moviereview
15239	8853_2	 , it fails to lend the characters ' individual stories enough dramatic resonance to make us care about them .  	disgust	moviereview
15261	8854_1	 that this doting mother would shun her kids , travel to one of the most dangerous parts of the world , don fatigues and become G.I. Jane  	disgust	moviereview
15282	8854_2	 Somehow we 're meant to buy 	noemotion	moviereview
15303	8855_1	 that none of the characters comes off as big  	disgust	moviereview
15324	8855_2	 The cast is so low-wattage 	disgust	moviereview
15344	8855_3	 ... and the setting remains indistinct .  	disgust	moviereview
15364	8856_1	 that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept  	disgust	moviereview
15385	8856_2	 Consider the title 's clunk-on-the-head 	disgust	moviereview
8445	8857_1	The movie quickly drags on becoming boring and predictable .	disgust	moviereview
2928	8858_1	I tried to read the time on my watch .	noemotion	moviereview
2140	8859_1	The film makes a tragic error by going on for too long , trying to mirror every subsequent event in Chinese history : war , revolution , Communism , etc. .	disgust	moviereview
1545	885_1	It 's neither as romantic nor as thrilling as it should be .	disgust	moviereview
15407	8860_1	 he is not nearly up to  	disgust	moviereview
15427	8860_2	 Johnson has , in his first film , set himself a task 	disgust	moviereview
15449	8861_1	 comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , ` What 's the point ? '  	disgust	moviereview
15469	8861_2	 Ultimately the project 	noemotion	moviereview
23905	8862_1	  The two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , 	disgust	moviereview
23906	8862_2	  but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect . 	disgust	moviereview
15491	8863_1	 because it was too overbearing  	disgust	moviereview
15511	8863_2	 The film meant well in its horse tale about freedom , but was n't able to reach the heart 	disgust	moviereview
15533	8864_1	 to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain  	disgust	moviereview
15553	8864_2	 as you can get from racy  	disgust	moviereview
15574	8864_3	 The movie is as far 	disgust	moviereview
15612	8864_5	 ; it has a dull , costumey feel .  	disgust	moviereview
15632	8865_1	 for them to really care  	noemotion	moviereview
15653	8865_2	 Once the audience figure out what 's being said  	disgust	moviereview
15674	8865_3	 , the filmmaker 's relative passivity will make it tough 	disgust	moviereview
15695	8866_1	 in which it studiously avoids provoking thought  	disgust	moviereview
15717	8866_2	 There 's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways 	disgust	moviereview
2141	8867_1	It seems just a long , convoluted ploy to get men into drag -- period drag , no less .	disgust	moviereview
24962	8868_1	  The premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs 	disgust	moviereview
24963	8868_2	  and a pitcher of margaritas in , 	disgust	moviereview
24964	8868_3	  but the film must have been written ... in the thrall of a vicious hangover . 	disgust	moviereview
2142	8869_1	Even by dumb action-movie standards , Ballistic : Ecks vs. Sever is a dumb action movie .	disgust	moviereview
7628	886_1	 its unusual relationship slowly unfolds  	anticipation	moviereview
7629	886_2	 But it offers plenty to ponder and chew on as 	joy	moviereview
15740	8870_1	 whose contents get  	disgust	moviereview
15761	8870_2	 The film equivalent of a toy chest 	disgust	moviereview
15782	8870_3	 scattered over the course of 80 minutes .  	disgust	moviereview
2143	8871_1	Just a bloody mess .	disgust	moviereview
8446	8872_1	Creepy but ultimately unsatisfying thriller .	disgust	moviereview
15805	8873_1	 that serves as the soundtrack  	disgust	moviereview
15825	8873_2	 You would be better off investing in the worthy EMI recording 	disgust	moviereview
15846	8873_3	 , or the home video of the 1992 Malfitano-Domingo production .  	disgust	moviereview
24965	8874_1	  Has something to say ... 	disgust	moviereview
24966	8874_2	  but it is a statement 	noemotion	moviereview
24967	8874_3	  and issue worthy of a much more thoughtfulness 	disgust	moviereview
24968	8874_4	  and insight than a melodramatic 	joy	moviereview
24969	8874_5	  and wholly predictable thriller . 	disgust	moviereview
2144	8875_1	Bears is bad .	disgust	moviereview
24970	8876_1	  Not ` terrible filmmaking ' bad , 	disgust	moviereview
24971	8876_2	  but more like , ' I once had a nightmare like this , 	disgust	moviereview
24972	8876_3	  and it 's now coming true ' bad . 	disgust	moviereview
15869	8877_1	 As is most commonly case with projects such noble and lofty ambitions  	disgust	moviereview
15891	8877_2	 , the film is less poetic than simply pretentious .  	disgust	moviereview
21320	8878_1	  George , hire a real director 	disgust	moviereview
21321	8878_2	  and good writers for the next installment , please . 	disgust	moviereview
21322	8879_1	  For a film about two mismatched buddies , Crystal 	disgust	moviereview
21323	8879_2	  and De Niro share little screen time 	noemotion	moviereview
21324	8879_3	  and even less chemistry . 	disgust	moviereview
25710	887_1	  Occasionally funny , always very colorful 	joy	moviereview
25711	887_2	  and enjoyably overblown in the traditional Almod var style . 	joy	moviereview
15910	8880_1	 whether this should , indeed , have been presented as a theatrical release  	disgust	moviereview
15932	8880_2	 However clever Nelson has been in providing variation within the confines of her structure and staging , the question remains 	joy	moviereview
15955	8881_1	 - oops , ops , no matter how you spell it , it 's still a mistake to go see it  	disgust	moviereview
15975	8881_2	 Extreme Oops 	disgust	moviereview
21325	8882_1	  What could 	disgust	moviereview
21326	8882_2	  and should have been biting 	disgust	moviereview
21327	8882_3	  and droll is instead a tepid waste of time and talent .	disgust	moviereview
2145	8883_1	What will , most likely , turn out to be the most repellent movie of 2002 .	disgust	moviereview
15998	8884_1	 ... too dull to enjoy  	disgust	moviereview
16040	8885_1	 tale whose thought-provoking potential is hampered by a made-for-TV look , rigid performances and an asinine ` twist ' that brazenly rips off The Sixth Sense  	disgust	moviereview
16063	8885_2	 A morality 	disgust	moviereview
940	8886_1	Here 's a self-congratulatory 3D IMAX rah-rah .	disgust	moviereview
21328	8887_1	  Eastwood is an icon of moviemaking , one of the best actors , directors 	joy	moviereview
21329	8887_2	  and producers around , responsible for some excellent work . 	joy	moviereview

16127	8890_1	 if you 're more than six years old  	disgust	moviereview
16147	8890_2	 It 's all very cute , though not terribly funny 	disgust	moviereview
1380	8891_1	The impact of the Armenian genocide is diluted by too much stage business in the modern day .	disgust	moviereview
21330	8892_1	  Going to the website may be just as fun -LRB- 	joy	moviereview
21331	8892_2	  and scary -RRB- as going to the film . 	joy	moviereview
21332	8893_1	  Lacking gravitas , MacDowell is a placeholder for grief , 	disgust	moviereview
21333	8893_2	  and ergo this sloppy drama is an empty vessel . 	disgust	moviereview
2146	8894_1	Leave these Flowers unpicked -- they 're dead on the vine .	disgust	moviereview
23907	8895_1	  Admirable , certainly , 	disgust	moviereview
23908	8895_2	  but not much fun to watch . 	disgust	moviereview
4348	8896_1	For Caine Lovers only .	disgust	moviereview
21334	8897_1	  A shambles of a movie -- visually unattractive , unbearably loud 	disgust	moviereview
21335	8897_2	  and utterly silly ... its hilarity is completely unintentional . 	disgust	moviereview
2147	8898_1	De Niro may enjoy the same free ride from critics afforded to Clint Eastwood in the lazy Bloodwork .	disgust	moviereview
2148	8899_1	But like Bruce Springsteen 's gone-to-pot Asbury Park , New Jersey , this sad-sack waste of a movie is a City of ruins .	disgust	moviereview
119	889_1	Some movies are like a tasty hors-doeuvre ; this one is a feast .	joy	moviereview
24304	88_1	  Painful to watch , 	disgust	moviereview

2149	8900_1	No , it 's not nearly as good as any of its influences .	disgust	moviereview
24973	8901_1	  A reasonably efficient mechanism , 	joy	moviereview
24974	8901_2	  but it offers few surprises 	disgust	moviereview
24975	8901_3	  and finds its stars slumming in territory they should have avoided . 	disgust	moviereview
16168	8902_1	 than suspense De Palma creates  	disgust	moviereview
16190	8902_2	 although it 's more comedy  	joy	moviereview
16211	8902_3	 The rest of the plot is impossible to explain without blowing whatever tension there is , 	joy	moviereview
16229	8902_4	 than suspense De Palma creates .  	noemotion	moviereview
16249	8903_1	 that distinguishes the merely quirky from the surreal  	disgust	moviereview
16270	8903_2	 Human Nature talks the talk , but it fails to walk the silly walk 	disgust	moviereview
21336	8904_1	  City by the Sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving : It 's careful , conscientious 	joy	moviereview
21337	8904_2	  and makes no major mistakes . 	joy	moviereview
16292	8905_1	 But what saves lives on the freeway  	joy	moviereview
16334	8905_3	 does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing .  	disgust	moviereview
16356	8906_1	 as this film makes him out to be  	disgust	moviereview
16378	8906_2	 The Marquis de Sade could n't have been as dull a person 	disgust	moviereview
16399	8907_1	 What could have been a neat little story about believing in yourself  	joy	moviereview
16420	8907_2	 is swamped by heavy-handed melodrama .  	disgust	moviereview
23909	8908_1	  The cast is uniformly excellent ... 	joy	moviereview
23910	8908_2	  but the film itself is merely mildly charming . 	joy	moviereview
16441	8909_1	 that Three Seasons achieved but loses its way in rhetorical excess and blatant sentimentality  	disgust	moviereview
16464	8909_2	 Drives for the same kind of bittersweet , conciliatory tone 	disgust	moviereview
7630	890_1	 What could have become just another cautionary fable is allowed to play out as a clever ,	joy	moviereview
7631	890_2	 charming tale -- as pleasantly in its own way as its self-dramatizing characters . 	joy	moviereview
2150	8910_1	A bigger holiday downer than your end-of-year 401 -LRB- k -RRB- statement .	disgust	moviereview
2151	8911_1	The whole thing plays out with the drowsy heaviness of synchronized swimmer wearing a wool wetsuit .	disgust	moviereview
23911	8912_1	  Fairly successful at faking some pretty cool stunts 	joy	moviereview
23912	8912_2	  but a complete failure at trying to create some pretty cool characters . 	disgust	moviereview
2152	8913_1	And forget about any attempt at a plot !	disgust	moviereview
23913	8914_1	  It will probably prove interesting to Ram Dass fans , 	joy	moviereview
23914	8914_2	  but to others it may feel like a parody of the mellow , peace-and-love side of the '60s counterculture . 	disgust	moviereview
16486	8915_1	 you have left  	disgust	moviereview
16508	8915_2	 Take away all the cliches and the carbon copy scenes from every drug movie we 've seen and all 	disgust	moviereview
16530	8915_3	 are John Leguizamo 's cool jackets .  	disgust	moviereview
16553	8916_1	 that all you can do is shake your head in disbelief -- and worry about what classic Oliver Parker intends to mangle next time  	disgust	moviereview
16575	8916_2	 It 's so full of wrong choices 	disgust	moviereview
2153	8917_1	Showtime is closer to Slowtime .	disgust	moviereview
23915	8918_1	  It may be an easy swipe to take , 	disgust	moviereview
23916	8918_2	  but this Barbershop just does n't make the cut . 	disgust	moviereview
23917	8919_1	  The Weight of Water uses water as a metaphor for subconscious desire , 	disgust	moviereview
23918	8919_2	  but this leaky script barely stays afloat . 	disgust	moviereview

21339	8921_2	  and a provocative title , writer-director Peter Mattei 's first feature microwaves dull leftover romantic motifs basted in faux-contemporary gravy . 	disgust	moviereview
21340	8922_1	  Fans of the TV series will be disappointed , 	disgust	moviereview
21341	8922_2	  and everyone else will be slightly bored . 	disgust	moviereview

16709	8925_2	 It 's disappointing 	disgust	moviereview
2154	8926_1	I Spy is an embarrassment , a monotonous , disjointed jumble of borrowed plot points and situations .	disgust	moviereview

16753	8927_2	 It 's as flat 	disgust	moviereview

21344	8933_1	  Safe Conduct , however ambitious 	disgust	moviereview
21345	8933_2	  and well-intentioned , fails to hit the entertainment bull 's - eye . 	disgust	moviereview
4349	8934_1	My response to the film is best described as lukewarm .	disgust	moviereview
4350	8935_1	Maybe I found the proceedings a little bit too conventional .	disgust	moviereview
2156	8936_1	Too timid to bring a sense of closure to an ugly chapter of the twentieth century .	disgust	moviereview

16838	8937_2	 so extensively that good bits are hopelessly overshadowed  	disgust	moviereview
16859	8937_3	 It 's push-the-limits teen comedy , the type written by people 	disgust	moviereview

21346	8938_1	  It 's too long , too repetitive , 	disgust	moviereview

4351	8939_1	A sudsy cautionary tale .	disgust	moviereview
7634	893_1	 Once you get into its rhythm  	anticipation	moviereview
7635	893_2	 the movie becomes a heady experience . 	joy	moviereview

2180	9067_1	The stupidest , most insulting movie of 2002 's first quarter .	disgust	moviereview
14709	9068_1	 that you ca n't figure out just where the other characters , including Ana 's father and grandfather , come down on the issue of Ana 's future  	disgust	moviereview
14731	9068_2	 It 's so underwritten 	disgust	moviereview
14751	9069_1	 that it is impossible to care whether that boast is true or not  	disgust	moviereview
14773	9069_2	 A film so tedious 	disgust	moviereview
25717	906_1	  It 's a nicely detailed world of pawns , bishops 	joy	moviereview
25718	906_2	  and kings , of wagers in dingy backrooms or pristine forests . 	joy	moviereview
23925	9070_1	  None of this violates the letter of Behan 's book , 	trust	moviereview
23926	9070_2	  but missing is its spirit , its ribald , full-throated humor . 	disgust	moviereview
23927	9071_1	  Bad Company leaves a bad taste , not only because of its bad-luck timing , 	disgust	moviereview
23928	9071_2	  but also the staleness of its script . 	disgust	moviereview
14795	9072_1	 Even if it ultimately disappoints  	disgust	moviereview
14817	9072_2	 , the picture does have about a matinee admission 's worth of funny to keep it afloat .  	disgust	moviereview
2181	9073_1	Fails to bring as much to the table .	disgust	moviereview
21384	9074_1	  A film made with as little wit , interest , 	disgust	moviereview
21385	9074_2	  and professionalism as artistically possible for a slummy Hollywood caper flick . 	disgust	moviereview
2182	9075_1	Disturbingly superficial in its approach to the material .	disgust	moviereview
14838	9076_1	 If you 're not the target demographic  	disgust	moviereview
14858	9076_2	 ... this movie is one long chick-flick slog .  	disgust	moviereview
2183	9077_1	I hate this movie	disgust	moviereview
14880	9078_1	 which is in more abundant supply in this woefully hackneyed movie , directed by Scott Kalvert , about street gangs and turf wars in 1958 Brooklyn -- stale cliches , gratuitous violence , or empty machismo  	disgust	moviereview
14899	9078_2	 It 's tough to tell 	disgust	moviereview
14921	9079_1	 which , as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through Snow Dogs , seems inconceivable  	disgust	moviereview
14941	9079_2	 Gooding and Coburn are both Oscar winners , a fact 	noemotion	moviereview
7646	907_1	 that could have been a reject from Monty Python 's Meaning of Life . 	noemotion	moviereview
7647	907_2	 A charming , quirky and leisurely paced Scottish comedy -- except with an outrageous central gimmick 	joy	moviereview
14961	9080_1	 while Banderas looks like he 's not trying to laugh at how bad  	disgust	moviereview
14981	9080_2	 At every opportunity to do something clever , the film goes right over the edge and kills every sense of believability ... all you have left is a no-surprise series of explosions and violence 	disgust	moviereview
2184	9081_1	... pitiful , slapdash disaster .	disgust	moviereview
2185	9082_1	A DOA dud from frame one .	disgust	moviereview
15001	9083_1	 that is not even as daring as John Ritter 's glory days on Three 's Company  	disgust	moviereview
15023	9083_2	 Jaw-droppingly superficial , straining to get by on humor 	disgust	moviereview
15042	9084_1	 that do work , but rarely do they involve the title character herself  	disgust	moviereview
15063	9084_2	 There are plenty of scenes in Frida 	disgust	moviereview
15082	9085_1	 that it was intended to be a different kind of film  	disgust	moviereview
15103	9085_2	 Although God Is Great addresses interesting matters of identity and heritage  	joy	moviereview
15121	9085_3	 , it 's hard to shake the feeling 	disgust	moviereview
15141	9086_1	 as things turn nasty and tragic during the final third of the film  	disgust	moviereview
15160	9086_2	 The dark and bittersweet twist feels strange 	disgust	moviereview
2186	9087_1	First-timer John McKay is never able to pull it back on course .	disgust	moviereview
15179	9088_1	 that the genuine ones barely register  	disgust	moviereview
15199	9088_2	 Distances you by throwing out so many red herrings , so many false scares , 	disgust	moviereview
15220	9089_1	 if that 's not too glorified a term  	disgust	moviereview
15240	9089_2	 Godard uses his characters -- 	noemotion	moviereview
15262	9089_3	 -- as art things , mouthpieces , visual motifs , blanks .  	noemotion	moviereview
3657	908_1	It never fails to engage us .	joy	moviereview
15283	9090_1	 plot points with a degree of randomness usually achieved only by lottery drawing  	disgust	moviereview
15304	9090_2	 The movie generates 	noemotion	moviereview
2187	9091_1	A predictable , manipulative stinker .	disgust	moviereview
15325	9092_1	 until it 's time for an absurd finale of twisted metal , fireballs and revenge  	disgust	moviereview
15345	9092_2	 The story passes time 	disgust	moviereview
21386	9093_1	  Eastwood winces , clutches his chest 	disgust	moviereview
21387	9093_2	  and gasps for breath . 	fear	moviereview
15365	9094_1	 it 's only acting  	noemotion	moviereview
15386	9094_2	 It 's a spectacular performance - ahem , we hope 	joy	moviereview
15408	9095_1	 that 's shapeless and uninflected  	disgust	moviereview
15428	9095_2	 The movie suffers from two fatal ailments -- a dearth of vitality and a story 	disgust	moviereview
15450	9096_1	 where Human Nature should be ingratiating  	disgust	moviereview
15470	9096_2	 It 's just weirdness for the sake of weirdness , and 	disgust	moviereview
15492	9096_3	 , it 's just grating .  	disgust	moviereview
4367	9097_1	An ambitiously naturalistic , albeit half-baked , drama about an abused , inner-city autistic teen .	joy	moviereview
15512	9098_1	 once she lets her love depraved leads meet , -LRB- Denis ' -RRB- story becomes a hopeless , unsatisfying muddle  	disgust	moviereview
21388	9099_1	  The dose is strong 	disgust	moviereview
21389	9099_2	  and funny , for the first 15 minutes anyway ; after that , the potency wanes dramatically . 	disgust	moviereview
7648	909_1	 you 're in the mood for  	noemotion	moviereview
7649	909_2	 Its direction , its script , and Weaver 's performance as a vaguely discontented woman of substance make for a mildly entertaining 77 minutes , if that 's what 	joy	moviereview
6906	90_1	 gritty as a movie gets these days  	joy	moviereview
6907	90_2	 A few artsy flourishes aside , Narc is as 	joy	moviereview
4368	9100_1	The people in ABC Africa are treated as docile , mostly wordless ethnographic extras .	noemotion	moviereview
15554	9101_1	 that 's TV sitcom material at best  	disgust	moviereview
15575	9101_2	 What 's really sad is to see two Academy Award winning actresses  	disgust	moviereview
15594	9101_3	 -LRB- and one Academy Award winning actor -RRB- succumb to appearing in this junk 	disgust	moviereview
21390	9102_1	  No doubt the star 	joy	moviereview
21391	9102_2	  and everyone else involved had their hearts in the right place . 	joy	moviereview
15613	9103_1	 Where their heads were  	disgust	moviereview
15633	9103_2	 is anyone 's guess .  	disgust	moviereview
23929	9104_1	  Call me a cynic , 	disgust	moviereview
23930	9104_2	  but there 's something awfully deadly about any movie with a life-affirming message . 	disgust	moviereview
21392	9105_1	  A gratingly unfunny groaner littered with zero-dimensional , unlikable characters 	disgust	moviereview
21393	9105_2	  and hackneyed , threadbare comic setups . 	disgust	moviereview
21394	9106_1	  Got some good , organic character work , lots of obvious political insights 	joy	moviereview
21395	9106_2	  and little room for engaging , imaginative filmmaking in its nearly 2Ã ‚ Â 1/2 - hour , dissipated length . 	joy	moviereview
2188	9107_1	A painfully slow cliche-ridden film filled with more holes than Clyde Barrow 's car .	disgust	moviereview
4369	9108_1	Like leafing through an album of photos accompanied by the sketchiest of captions .	noemotion	moviereview
15654	9109_1	 it just goes to show that if you give a filmmaker an unlimited amount of phony blood , nothing good can happen  	disgust	moviereview
15675	9109_2	 I guess 	disgust	moviereview
7650	910_1	 is by far the lightest Dogme film and among the most enjoyable  	joy	moviereview
7651	910_2	 A charming romantic comedy that 	joy	moviereview
15696	9110_1	 that makes the silly , over-the-top coda especially disappointing  	disgust	moviereview
15718	9110_2	 Gaghan captures the half-lit , sometimes creepy intimacy of college dorm rooms , a subtlety 	disgust	moviereview
4370	9111_1	Feels less like a change in -LRB- Herzog 's -RRB- personal policy than a half-hearted fluke .	disgust	moviereview
2189	9112_1	One of the most unpleasant things the studio has ever produced .	disgust	moviereview
15741	9113_1	 who is n't a Fangoria subscriber  	disgust	moviereview
15762	9113_2	 that it has n't gone straight to video ?  	disgust	moviereview
15783	9113_3	 Will anyone 	noemotion	moviereview
15806	9113_4	 be excited 	disgust	moviereview
4371	9114_1	A selection of scenes in search of a movie .	disgust	moviereview
15826	9115_1	 which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes , maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies  	disgust	moviereview
15847	9115_2	 -LRB- Janey -RRB- forgets about her other obligations , leading to a tragedy 	sadness	moviereview
15870	9116_1	 where Mr. Besson is a brand name  	noemotion	moviereview
15892	9116_2	 where Ms. Shu is an institution , but American audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic  	disgust	moviereview
15911	9116_3	 Will undoubtedly play well in European markets , 	disgust	moviereview
15933	9116_4	 , and in Asia , 	noemotion	moviereview
15956	9117_1	 as stiff , ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus ... ` The Country Bears ' should never have been brought out of hibernation  	disgust	moviereview
15976	9117_2	 True to its animatronic roots : ... 	joy	moviereview
21396	9118_1	  -LRB- Evans is -RRB- a fascinating character , 	disgust	moviereview
21397	9118_2	  and deserves a better vehicle than this facetious smirk of a movie . 	disgust	moviereview
21398	9119_1	  The script 's judgment 	disgust	moviereview
21399	9119_2	  and sense of weight is way , way off . 	disgust	moviereview
7652	911_1	 This is the kind of movie 	noemotion	moviereview
7653	911_2	 used to be right at home at the Saturday matinee , and it still is . 	joy	moviereview
15999	9120_1	 that the movie spent a lot less time trying to make a credible case for reports from the afterlife and a lot more time on the romantic urgency that 's at the center of the story  	disgust	moviereview
16019	9120_2	 You come away wishing , though , 	disgust	moviereview
24976	9121_1	  Evelyn may be based on a true 	disgust	moviereview
24977	9121_2	  and historically significant story , 	disgust	moviereview
24978	9121_3	  but the filmmakers have made every effort to disguise it as an unimaginative screenwriter 's invention . 	disgust	moviereview
21400	9122_1	  A derivative collection of horror 	disgust	moviereview
21401	9122_2	  and sci-fi cliches . 	disgust	moviereview
21402	9123_1	  Loosely speaking , we 're in All of Me territory again , 	disgust	moviereview
21403	9123_2	  and , strictly speaking , Schneider is no Steve Martin . 	disgust	moviereview
16041	9124_1	 two hours feel like four  	disgust	moviereview
16064	9124_2	 As aimless as an old pickup skidding completely out of control on a long patch of black ice , the movie makes 	disgust	moviereview
21404	9125_1	  Limps along on a squirm-inducing fish-out-of-water formula that goes nowhere 	disgust	moviereview
21405	9125_2	  and goes there very , very slowly . 	disgust	moviereview
16086	9126_1	 that gives movies about ordinary folk a bad name  	disgust	moviereview
16107	9126_2	 Just the sort of lazy tearjerker 	disgust	moviereview
16128	9127_1	 what 's worse , routine  	disgust	moviereview
16148	9127_2	 The redeeming feature of Chan 's films has always been the action , but the stunts in The Tuxedo seem tired and , 	disgust	moviereview
16169	9128_1	 While The Importance of Being Earnest offers opportunities for occasional smiles and chuckles  	disgust	moviereview
16191	9128_2	 , it does n't give us a reason to be in the theater beyond Wilde 's wit and the actors ' performances .  	disgust	moviereview
2190	9129_1	Has all the scenic appeal of a cesspool .	disgust	moviereview
25719	912_1	  The spark of special anime magic here is unmistakable 	joy	moviereview
25720	912_2	  and hard to resist . 	joy	moviereview
21406	9130_1	  A rambling ensemble piece with loosely connected characters 	disgust	moviereview
21407	9130_2	  and plots that never quite gel . 	disgust	moviereview
4372	9131_1	A Lifetime movie about men .	noemotion	moviereview

16230	9133_2	 groupies out there  	disgust	moviereview
16250	9133_3	 It 's hard to say 	noemotion	moviereview
16271	9133_4	 , are there Tolstoy 	noemotion	moviereview
16293	9134_1	 the business of the greedy talent agents get in the way of saying something meaningful about facing death  	disgust	moviereview
16313	9134_2	 It 's dark and tragic , and lets 	disgust	moviereview
16335	9135_1	 that starts out like Heathers  	noemotion	moviereview
16357	9135_2	 This is a movie 	noemotion	moviereview
16379	9135_3	 , then becomes Bring it On , then becomes unwatchable .  	disgust	moviereview
2191	9136_1	The screenplay flounders under the weight of too many story lines .	disgust	moviereview
16400	9137_1	 it was Plato who said  	noemotion	moviereview
16421	9137_2	 I think 	noemotion	moviereview
16442	9137_3	 , ' I think , therefore I know better than to rush to the theatre for this one . '  	disgust	moviereview
16465	9138_1	 If Damon and Affleck attempt another Project Greenlight 	disgust	moviereview
16487	9138_2	 next time out they might try paying less attention to the miniseries and more attention to the film  it is about .  	disgust	moviereview
21408	9139_1	  This is rote drivel aimed at Mom 	disgust	moviereview
21409	9139_2	  and Dad 's wallet . 	disgust	moviereview
25721	913_1	  Like its two predecessors , 1983 's Koyaanisqatsi 	noemotion	moviereview
25722	913_2	  and 1988 's Powaqqatsi , the cinematic collage Naqoyqatsi could be the most navel-gazing film ever . 	disgust	moviereview
16509	9140_1	 if this sappy script was the best the contest received  	disgust	moviereview
16531	9140_2	 Contrived , maudlin and cliche-ridden ... 	disgust	moviereview
16554	9140_3	 , those rejected must have been astronomically bad .  	disgust	moviereview
2192	9141_1	I hate the feeling of having been slimed in the name of High Art .	disgust	moviereview
4373	9142_1	This is more a case of ` Sacre bleu ! '	disgust	moviereview
2938	9143_1	than ` Magnifique ' .	noemotion	moviereview
16576	9144_1	 that they are  	noemotion	moviereview
16599	9144_2	 The kids in the audience at the preview screening seemed bored , cheering the pratfalls but little else ; their parents , wise folks 	disgust	moviereview
16622	9144_3	 , read books .  	noemotion	moviereview
16643	9145_1	 Whether Jason X is this bad on purpose  	disgust	moviereview
16664	9145_2	 is never clear .  	disgust	moviereview
4374	9146_1	But one thing 's for sure : It never comes close to being either funny or scary .	disgust	moviereview
2193	9147_1	Yet another weepy Southern bore-athon .	disgust	moviereview
24979	9148_1	  I like all four of the lead actors a lot 	joy	moviereview
24980	9148_2	  and they manage to squeeze a few laughs out of the material , 	joy	moviereview
24981	9148_3	  but they 're treading water at best in this forgettable effort . 	disgust	moviereview
16687	9149_1	 Who Is Cletis Tout 	disgust	moviereview
16710	9149_2	 Perhaps the most annoying thing about 	disgust	moviereview
23256	914_1	  Baran is n't the most transporting or gripping film from Iran -- or , indeed , by its director -- 	disgust	moviereview
23257	914_2	  but it 's a worthy companion to the many fine , focused films emerging from that most surprising of nations . 	joy	moviereview
16754	9150_1	 is that it 's a crime movie made by someone who obviously knows nothing about crime  	disgust	moviereview
16797	9151_1	 what anyone saw in this film that allowed it to get made  	disgust	moviereview
16818	9151_2	 Except as an acting exercise or an exceptionally dark joke , you wonder 	disgust	moviereview
2194	9152_1	This insufferable movie is meant to make you think about existential suffering .	disgust	moviereview
2195	9153_1	Instead , it 'll only put you to sleep .	disgust	moviereview
2939	9154_1	Who is this movie for ?	noemotion	moviereview
16839	9155_1	 who do n't need the lesson in repugnance  	noemotion	moviereview
16860	9155_2	 Not kids , 	noemotion	moviereview
16882	9156_1	 poo-poo jokes are ` edgy  	disgust	moviereview
16902	9156_2	 It 's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers -- not everyone thinks 	disgust	moviereview
21410	9157_1	  A sleep-inducingly slow-paced crime drama with clumsy dialogue , heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment , 	disgust	moviereview
21411	9157_2	  and an overly-familiar set of plot devices . 	disgust	moviereview
16943	9158_1	 that it makes you forgive every fake , dishonest , entertaining and , ultimately , more perceptive moment in Bridget Jones 's Diary  	disgust	moviereview
16961	9158_2	 It 's so tedious 	disgust	moviereview
2196	9159_1	Almost as offensive as `` Freddy Got Fingered . ''	disgust	moviereview
125	915_1	The visuals alone make Metropolis worth seeing .	joy	moviereview
16983	9160_1	 if the movie knew what to do with him  	disgust	moviereview
17005	9160_2	 The gifted Crudup has the perfect face to play a handsome blank yearning to find himself , and his cipherlike personality and bad behavior would play fine 	joy	moviereview
21412	9161_1	  It is depressing , ruthlessly pained 	disgust	moviereview
21413	9161_2	  and depraved , the movie equivalent of staring into an open wound . 	disgust	moviereview
2197	9162_1	Ponderous , plodding soap opera disguised as a feature film .	disgust	moviereview
2198	9163_1	Cold , pretentious , thoroughly dislikable study in sociopathy .	disgust	moviereview
17026	9164_1	 Mr. Plympton will find room for one more member of his little band , a professional screenwriter  	anticipation	moviereview
17048	9164_2	 For the future , one hopes 	disgust	moviereview
21414	9165_1	  A cheap scam put together by some cynical creeps at Revolution Studios 	disgust	moviereview
21415	9165_2	  and Imagine Entertainment to make the suckers out there surrender $ 9 	disgust	moviereview
21416	9165_3	  and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life . 	disgust	moviereview
23931	9166_1	  Reign of Fire never comes close to recovering from its demented premise , 	disgust	moviereview
23932	9166_2	  but it does sustain an enjoyable level of ridiculousness . 	disgust	moviereview
17070	9167_1	 that Malkovich was  	disgust	moviereview
17091	9167_2	 Human Nature is a goofball movie , in the way 	disgust	moviereview
17113	9167_3	 , but it tries too hard .  	disgust	moviereview
2199	9168_1	Originality is sorely lacking .	disgust	moviereview
4375	9169_1	The plot 's clearly mythic structure may owe more to Disney 's strong sense of formula than to the original story .	joy	moviereview
25723	916_1	  Dark , resonant , inventively detailed 	joy	moviereview
25724	916_2	  and packed with fleet turns of plot 	joy	moviereview
25725	916_3	  and a feast of visual amazement . 	joy	moviereview
17136	9170_1	 But while the highly predictable narrative falls short  	disgust	moviereview
17180	9170_3	 , Treasure Planet is truly gorgeous to behold .  	joy	moviereview
17203	9171_1	 Though there are entertaining and audacious moments  	disgust	moviereview
17225	9171_2	 , the movie 's wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance do little to salvage this filmmaker 's flailing reputation .  	disgust	moviereview
942	9172_1	Ram Dass Fierce Grace moulds itself as an example to up-and-coming documentarians , of the overlooked pitfalls of such an endeavour .	joy	moviereview
24982	9173_1	  Lucky Break is perfectly inoffensive 	disgust	moviereview
24983	9173_2	  and harmless , 	disgust	moviereview
24984	9173_3	  but it 's also drab and inert .	disgust	moviereview
21417	9174_1	  For a story set at sea , Ghost Ship is pretty landbound , with its leaden acting , dull exposition 	disgust	moviereview
21418	9174_2	  and telegraphed ` surprises . ' 	disgust	moviereview
17246	9175_1	 but who the hell cares  	disgust	moviereview
17267	9175_2	 There might be some sort of credible gender-provoking philosophy submerged here ,  	anticipation	moviereview
2200	9176_1	Nothing more than a stifling morality tale dressed up in peekaboo clothing .	disgust	moviereview
21419	9177_1	  I like my Christmas movies with more elves  and snow 	disgust	moviereview
21420	9177_3	  and less pimps  and ho 's .	noemotion	moviereview
21421	9178_1	  It all seemed wasted like DeNiro 's once promising career 	disgust	moviereview
21422	9178_2	  and the once grand Long Beach boardwalk . 	noemotion	moviereview
17290	9179_1	 as it should be  	disgust	moviereview
17310	9179_2	 that the movie deals with  	disgust	moviereview
17330	9179_3	 -LRB- I -RRB- t 's certainly laudable 	joy	moviereview
17351	9179_4	 hot-button issues in a comedic context , but Barbershop is n't as funny 	disgust	moviereview
7654	917_1	 extols the virtues of comradeship and community in a spunky , spirited fashion  	joy	moviereview
7655	917_2	 A picture that 	joy	moviereview
21423	9180_1	  Unfortunately , a cast of competent performers from movies , television 	disgust	moviereview
21424	9180_2	  and the theater are cast adrift in various New York City locations with no unifying rhythm or visual style . 	disgust	moviereview
4376	9181_1	Just entertaining enough not to hate , too mediocre to love .	disgust	moviereview

17396	9182_2	 ` Sophisticated ' viewers 	disgust	moviereview
17418	9182_3	 will likely call it ` challenging ' to their fellow sophisticates .  	disgust	moviereview
17440	9183_1	 as opposed to the manifesto  	disgust	moviereview
17462	9183_2	 Equilibrium the movie , 	noemotion	moviereview
17484	9183_3	 , is really , really stupid .  	disgust	moviereview
21425	9184_1	  Excruciatingly unfunny 	disgust	moviereview
21426	9184_2	  and pitifully unromantic . 	disgust	moviereview
21427	9185_1	  The film 's thoroughly recycled plot 	disgust	moviereview
21428	9185_2	  and tiresome jokes ... drag the movie down . 	disgust	moviereview
17503	9186_1	 what its point is  	disgust	moviereview
17521	9186_2	 It does n't offer audiences any way of gripping 	disgust	moviereview
17543	9186_3	 , or even its attitude toward its subject .  	disgust	moviereview
17560	9187_1	 that I even caught the gum stuck under my seat trying to sneak out of the theater  	disgust	moviereview
17582	9187_2	 This kiddie-oriented stinker is so bad 	disgust	moviereview
17603	9188_1	 Though Impostor deviously adopts the guise of a modern motion picture  	disgust	moviereview
17625	9188_2	 , it too is a bomb .  	disgust	moviereview
23933	9189_1	  Cox offers plenty of glimpses at existing photos , 	disgust	moviereview
23934	9189_2	  but there are no movies of Nijinsky , so instead the director treats us to an aimless hodgepodge . 	disgust	moviereview
3658	918_1	A resonant tale of racism , revenge and retribution .	joy	moviereview
2201	9190_1	Every note rings false .	disgust	moviereview
17646	9191_1	 When the screenwriter responsible for one of the worst movies of one year directs an equally miserable film the following year  	disgust	moviereview

17690	9191_3	 , you 'd have a hard time believing 	disgust	moviereview
4377	9192_1	It never rises to its clever what-if concept .	disgust	moviereview
23935	9193_1	  Admirably ambitious 	disgust	moviereview
23936	9193_2	  but self-indulgent . 	disgust	moviereview
2202	9194_1	This story of unrequited love does n't sustain interest beyond the first half-hour .	disgust	moviereview
21429	9195_1	  This angst-ridden territory was covered earlier 	disgust	moviereview
21430	9195_2	  and much better in Ordinary People . 	disgust	moviereview
17713	9196_1	 to play one lewd scene after another  	disgust	moviereview
17734	9196_2	 The entire film is one big excuse 	disgust	moviereview
17755	9197_1	 which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal  	disgust	moviereview
17775	9197_2	 About half of them are funny  	disgust	moviereview
17817	9197_4	 , a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story , 	disgust	moviereview
2203	9198_1	A big , loud , bang-the-drum bore .	disgust	moviereview
2204	9199_1	-LRB- Less a movie than -RRB- an appalling , odoriferous thing ... so rotten in almost every single facet of production that you 'll want to crawl up your own *** in embarrassment .	disgust	moviereview
25726	919_1	  Noyce 's film is contemplative 	joy	moviereview
25727	919_2	  and mournfully reflective . 	disgust	moviereview
6908	91_1	 While The Isle is both preposterous and thoroughly misogynistic  	disgust	moviereview
6909	91_2	 its vistas are incredibly beautiful to look at .	joy	moviereview
943	9200_1	The concept behind Kung Pow : Enter the Fist is hilarious .	joy	moviereview
17838	9201_1	 nothing else is  	noemotion	moviereview
17859	9201_2	 It 's too bad 	disgust	moviereview
17880	9202_1	 which is especially unfortunate in light of the fine work done by most of the rest of her cast  	disgust	moviereview
17902	9202_2	 Hardman is a grating , mannered onscreen presence , 	disgust	moviereview
17924	9203_1	 if used as a tool to rally anti-Catholic protestors  	noemotion	moviereview
17944	9203_2	 El Crimen Del Padre Amaro would likely be most effective 	disgust	moviereview
8448	9204_1	Interesting and thoroughly unfaithful version of Carmen	joy	moviereview
944	9205_1	A serious movie with serious ideas .	joy	moviereview
4378	9206_1	But seriously , folks , it does n't work .	disgust	moviereview
17965	9207_1	 that 's right  	noemotion	moviereview
17985	9207_2	 There 's nothing exactly wrong here , but there 's not nearly enough 	disgust	moviereview
21431	9208_1	  The action here is unusually tame , the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest , 	disgust	moviereview
21432	9208_2	  and the plot offers few surprises . 	disgust	moviereview
23937	9209_1	  I could n't help 	disgust	moviereview
23938	9209_2	  but feel the wasted potential of this slapstick comedy . 	disgust	moviereview
7656	920_1	 he is likely to get  	noemotion	moviereview
7657	920_2	 Here , Adrian Lyne comes as close to profundity as 	joy	moviereview
18006	9210_1	 What Madonna does here  	noemotion	moviereview
18028	9210_2	 ca n't properly be called acting -- more accurately , it 's moving and it 's talking and it 's occasionally gesturing , sometimes all at once .  	disgust	moviereview
2205	9211_1	-LRB- A -RRB- painfully flat gross-out comedy ...	disgust	moviereview
18049	9212_1	 Even if you 're an Elvis person  	noemotion	moviereview
18071	9212_2	 , you wo n't find anything to get excited about on this DVD .  	disgust	moviereview
24985	9213_1	  The movie certainly has its share of clever moments 	joy	moviereview
24986	9213_2	  and biting dialogue , 	disgust	moviereview
24987	9213_3	  but there 's just not much lurking below its abstract surface . 	disgust	moviereview
21433	9214_1	  It 's bedeviled by labored writing 	disgust	moviereview
21434	9214_2	  and slack direction . 	disgust	moviereview
18094	9215_1	 there 's a teenage boy out there somewhere who 's dying for this kind of entertainment  	disgust	moviereview
18116	9215_2	 I 'm sure 	noemotion	moviereview
18139	9216_1	 that allow the suit to come to life  	disgust	moviereview
18158	9216_2	 The Tuxedo miscalculates badly by forcing the star to play second fiddle to the dull effects 	disgust	moviereview
21435	9217_1	  The film is a confusing melange of tones 	disgust	moviereview
21436	9217_2	  and styles , one moment a romantic trifle 	noemotion	moviereview
21437	9217_3	  and the next a turgid drama . 	disgust	moviereview
2206	9218_1	Obviously , a lot of people wasted a lot of their time -LRB- including mine -RRB- on something very inconsequential .	disgust	moviereview
18180	9219_1	 as do Joan and Philip 's repetitive arguments , schemes and treachery  	disgust	moviereview
18203	9219_2	 There 's a little violence and lots of sex in a bid to hold our attention , but it grows monotonous after a while , 	disgust	moviereview
7658	921_1	 Evokes a little of the fear 	fear	moviereview
7659	921_2	    parents have for the possible futures of their children 	noemotion	moviereview
8262	921_3	 the sometimes bad choices mothers and fathers make in the interests of doing them good . 	joy	moviereview
18226	9220_1	 It drowns in sap  	disgust	moviereview
21438	9221_2	 Deliberately and devotedly constructed , Far from Heaven is too picture postcard perfect , too neat 	disgust	moviereview
21439	9221_3	  and new pin-like , too obviously a recreation to resonate . 	disgust	moviereview
18264	9222_1	 everything that 's good  	disgust	moviereview
18287	9222_2	 that 's just too boring and obvious  	disgust	moviereview
18309	9222_3	 that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline  	disgust	moviereview
18330	9222_4	 It 's rare 	noemotion	moviereview
18372	9222_6	 is ultimately scuttled by a plot 	disgust	moviereview
18393	9223_1	 it thumbs down due to the endlessly repetitive scenes of embarrassment  	disgust	moviereview
18415	9223_2	 I 'm giving 	disgust	moviereview
2207	9224_1	There 's got to be a more graceful way of portraying the devastation of this disease .	disgust	moviereview
18435	9225_1	 that it 's so inane that it gave me plenty of time to ponder my Thanksgiving to-do list  	disgust	moviereview
18457	9225_2	 The good thing -- the only good thing -- about Extreme Ops is 	disgust	moviereview
4379	9226_1	The modern-day characters are nowhere near as vivid as the 19th-century ones .	disgust	moviereview
8449	9227_1	Blessed with a searing lead performance by Ryan Gosling -LRB- Murder by Numbers -RRB- , the movie is powerful and provocative .	joy	moviereview
18477	9228_1	 it follows into melodrama and silliness  	disgust	moviereview
18499	9228_2	 It 's also built on a faulty premise , one 	disgust	moviereview
13071	9229_1	 that has no teeth  	disgust	moviereview
13094	9229_2	 Uneven performances and a spotty script add up to a biting satire 	disgust	moviereview
7660	922_1	 is anything but cathartic  	disgust	moviereview
7661	922_2	 Rain is a small treasure , enveloping the viewer in a literal and spiritual torpor that 	joy	moviereview
2208	9230_1	Director Jay Russell stomps in hobnail boots over Natalie Babbitt 's gentle , endearing 1975 children 's novel .	disgust	moviereview
21440	9231_1	  Benigni 's Pinocchio is extremely straight 	disgust	moviereview
21441	9231_2	  and mind-numbingly stilted , its episodic pacing keeping the film from developing any storytelling flow . 	disgust	moviereview
13116	9232_1	 that it does n't make any sense  	disgust	moviereview
13138	9232_2	 The troubling thing about Clockstoppers is 	disgust	moviereview
21442	9233_1	  With its paint fights , motorized scooter chases 	disgust	moviereview
21443	9233_2	  and dewy-eyed sentiment , it 's a pretty listless collection of kid-movie clichs . 	disgust	moviereview
21444	9234_1	  Mostly the film is just hectic 	disgust	moviereview
21445	9234_2	  and homiletic : two parts exhausting Men in Black mayhem to one part family values . 	disgust	moviereview
21446	9235_1	  Kicks off with an inauspicious premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings 	disgust	moviereview
21447	9235_2	  and then ends with a whimper . 	disgust	moviereview
8450	9236_1	A rote exercise in both animation and storytelling .	disgust	moviereview
21448	9237_1	  The material 	noemotion	moviereview
21449	9237_2	  and the production itself are little more than routine . 	disgust	moviereview
13160	9238_1	 the movie could have had  	disgust	moviereview
13183	9238_2	 The movie 's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula , though , and it 's quite enough to lessen the overall impact 	disgust	moviereview
21450	9239_1	  Not even Steven Spielberg has dreamed up such blatant 	disgust	moviereview
21451	9239_2	  and sickening product placement in a movie . 	disgust	moviereview
126	923_1	An elegant , exquisitely modulated psychological thriller .	joy	moviereview
4380	9240_1	It 's all surface psychodramatics .	disgust	moviereview
13206	9241_1	 which is mostly a bore  	disgust	moviereview
13226	9241_2	 The Mothman Prophecies , 	noemotion	moviereview
13248	9241_3	 , seems to exist only for its climactic setpiece .  	disgust	moviereview
13271	9242_1	 that 's conspicuously missing from the Girls ' big-screen blowout  	disgust	moviereview
13292	9242_2	 That frenetic spectacle -LRB- on the TV show -RRB- has usually been leavened by a charm 	joy	moviereview
2209	9243_1	Kitschy , flashy , overlong soap opera .	disgust	moviereview
13314	9244_1	 we spend with these people  	noemotion	moviereview
13333	9244_2	 For all the time 	sadness	moviereview
13356	9244_3	 , we never really get inside of them .  	disgust	moviereview
13379	9245_1	 that fails to make adequate use of his particular talents  	disgust	moviereview
13402	9245_2	 Yet another Arnold vehicle 	disgust	moviereview
13422	9246_1	 a little too much ai n't - she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff  	disgust	moviereview
13443	9246_2	 Sandra Bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries 	joy	moviereview
4381	9247_1	An undistinguished attempt to make a classic theater piece cinematic .	disgust	moviereview
13464	9248_1	 in which the hero might have an opportunity to triumphantly sermonize  	disgust	moviereview
13486	9248_2	 and too few that allow us to wonder for ourselves if things will turn out okay  	anticipation	moviereview
13508	9248_3	 too many scenarios 	disgust	moviereview
2210	9249_1	There is simply not enough of interest onscreen to sustain its seventy-minute running time .	disgust	moviereview
7662	924_1	 its intended under-12 audience is concerned  	fear	moviereview
7663	924_2	 This concoction , so bizarre to the adult mind , is actually a charming triumph where 	joy	moviereview
4382	9250_1	A wordy wisp of a comedy .	disgust	moviereview
21452	9251_1	  Broomfield 's style of journalism is hardly journalism at all , 	disgust	moviereview
21453	9251_2	  and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient . 	disgust	moviereview
4383	9252_1	-LRB- Seagal 's -RRB- strenuous attempt at a change in expression could very well clinch him this year 's Razzie .	disgust	moviereview
2211	9253_1	Has the disjointed feel of a bunch of strung-together TV episodes .	disgust	moviereview
13549	9254_1	 that what is good for the goose  	disgust	moviereview
13572	9254_2	 some of which occasionally amuses but none of which amounts to much of a story  	disgust	moviereview
13592	9254_3	 A series of escapades demonstrating the adage 	disgust	moviereview
13615	9254_4	 is also good for the gander , 	joy	moviereview
13636	9255_1	 where uptight , middle class bores like Antonia can feel good about themselves  	disgust	moviereview
13657	9255_2	 Ozpetek offers an AIDS subtext , skims over the realities of gay sex , and presents yet another tired old vision of the gay community as an all-inclusive world 	disgust	moviereview
2212	9256_1	A dopey movie clothed in excess layers of hipness .	disgust	moviereview
13679	9257_1	 who do n't care what kind of sewage they shovel into their mental gullets to simulate sustenance  	disgust	moviereview
13699	9257_2	 The Sweetest Thing is expressly for idiots 	disgust	moviereview
13719	9258_1	 that even Freeman ca n't save it  	disgust	moviereview
13740	9258_2	 Sinks so low in a poorly played game of absurd plot twists , idiotic court maneuvers and stupid characters 	disgust	moviereview
13759	9259_1	 that no matter how fantastic Reign of Fire looked , its story was making no sense at all  	disgust	moviereview
13781	9259_2	 I realized 	noemotion	moviereview
7664	925_1	 's a sly , amusing , laugh-filled little gem in which the ultimate `` Bellini '' begins to look like a `` real Kaputschnik  	joy	moviereview
7665	925_2	 Droll caper-comedy remake of `` Big Deal on Madonna Street '' that 	noemotion	moviereview
13802	9260_1	 that we really have n't had a good cheesy B-movie playing in theaters  	joy	moviereview
13824	9260_2	 It made me realize 	joy	moviereview
13846	9260_3	 since ... well ... since last week 's Reign of Fire .  	joy	moviereview
21454	9261_1	  Some movies were made for the big screen , some for the small screen , 	disgust	moviereview
21455	9261_2	  and some , like Ballistic : Ecks vs. Sever , were made for the palm screen . 	disgust	moviereview
21456	9262_1	  SC2 is an autopilot Hollywood concoction lacking in imagination 	disgust	moviereview
21457	9262_2	  and authentic Christmas spirit , yet it 's geared toward an audience full of masters of both . 	joy	moviereview
4384	9263_1	After all the big build-up , the payoff for the audience , as well as the characters , is messy , murky , unsatisfying .	disgust	moviereview
21458	9264_1	  Seems content to dog-paddle in the mediocre end of the pool , 	disgust	moviereview
21459	9264_2	  and it 's a sad , sick sight . 	disgust	moviereview
13869	9265_1	 that someone understands the need for the bad boy  	trust	moviereview
13891	9265_2	 It 's refreshing 	joy	moviereview
13913	9265_3	 ; Diesel , with his brawny frame and cool , composed delivery , fits the bill perfectly .  	joy	moviereview
13932	9266_1	 If all of Eight Legged Freaks was as entertaining as the final hour  	disgust	moviereview
13954	9266_2	 , I would have no problem giving it an unqualified recommendation .  	disgust	moviereview
21460	9267_1	  Suffers from a flat script 	disgust	moviereview
21461	9267_2	  and a low budget . 	disgust	moviereview
13975	9268_1	 who would argue that entering a church , synagogue or temple does n't mean you have to check your brain at the door  	noemotion	moviereview
13996	9268_2	 There are deeply religious and spiritual people in this world 	noemotion	moviereview
2940	9269_1	The same should go for movie theaters .	noemotion	moviereview

25729	926_2	  and vulnerable characters living in the renown Chelsea Hotel ... 	fear	moviereview
2213	9270_1	Seemingly a vehicle to showcase the Canadian 's inane ramblings , Stealing Harvard is a smorgasbord of soliloquies about nothing delivered by the former Mr. Drew Barrymore .	disgust	moviereview
24988	9271_1	  The film tries to touch on spousal abuse 	disgust	moviereview
24989	9271_2	  but veers off course 	disgust	moviereview
24990	9271_3	  and becomes just another revenge film . 	disgust	moviereview
14019	9272_1	 As it stands  	joy	moviereview
14042	9272_2	 it 's an opera movie for the buffs .  	joy	moviereview

24994	9297_1	  A worthy idea , 	disgust	moviereview

2222	9311_1	The movie is a negligible work of manipulation , an exploitation piece doing its usual worst to guilt-trip parents .	disgust	moviereview
2223	9312_1	Lacks dramatic punch and depth .	disgust	moviereview
23939	9313_1	  There are moments of real pleasure to be found in Sara Sugarman 's whimsical comedy Very Annie-Mary 	joy	moviereview

15180	9317_2	 This is not one of the movies 	disgust	moviereview
15200	9318_1	 though Ford and Neeson capably hold our interest , but its just not a thrilling movie  	disgust	moviereview
15221	9318_2	 The first hour is tedious 	disgust	moviereview
15241	9319_1	 who do everything humanly possible to create characters who are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior  	disgust	moviereview
15263	9319_2	 Here 's a case of two actors 	disgust	moviereview
3660	931_1	Zany , exuberantly irreverent animated space adventure .	joy	moviereview
15284	9320_1	 what he gets  	disgust	moviereview
15305	9320_2	 It 's obvious -LRB- Je-Gyu is -RRB- trying for poetry ; 	disgust	moviereview
15326	9320_3	 instead has all the lyricism of a limerick scrawled in a public restroom .  	disgust	moviereview
15346	9321_1	 that it almost wins you over in the end  	disgust	moviereview
15366	9321_2	 Sweet Home Alabama is one dumb movie , but its stupidity is so relentlessly harmless 	disgust	moviereview
21470	9322_1	  -LRB- Green is -RRB- the comedy equivalent of Saddam Hussein , 	disgust	moviereview
21471	9322_2	  and I 'm just about ready to go to the U.N. 	disgust	moviereview
21472	9322_3	  and ask permission for a preemptive strike . 	disgust	moviereview
2225	9323_1	No amount of good acting is enough to save Oleander 's uninspired story .	disgust	moviereview
2226	9324_1	A vile , incoherent mess ... a scummy ripoff of David Cronenberg 's brilliant ` Videodrome . '	disgust	moviereview
24997	9325_1	  Murphy 	disgust	moviereview
24998	9325_2	  and Wilson actually make a pretty good team ... 	joy	moviereview
24999	9325_3	  but the project surrounding them is distressingly rote . 	disgust	moviereview
21473	9326_1	  Despite its raucous intent , XXX is as conventional as a Nike ad 	disgust	moviereview
21474	9326_2	  and as rebellious as spring break . 	disgust	moviereview
21475	9327_1	  Think The Lion King redone for horses , with fewer deliberate laughs , more inadvertent ones 	disgust	moviereview
21476	9327_2	  and stunningly trite songs by Bryan Adams , the world 's most generic rock star . 	disgust	moviereview
4387	9328_1	It is one more celluloid testimonial to the cruelties experienced by Southern blacks as distilled through a Caucasian perspective .	disgust	moviereview
15387	9329_1	 especially when the Man has taken away your car , your work-hours and denied you health insurance  	disgust	moviereview
15409	9329_2	 It 's tough being a black man in America , 	disgust	moviereview
7668	932_1	 eagerly and easily assimilated as an all-American girl with a brand new name in southern Tennessee  	joy	moviereview
7669	932_2	 Dolgin and Franco fashion a fascinating portrait of a Vietnamese-born youngster who 	joy	moviereview
15429	9330_1	 if the director , Tom Dey , had spliced together bits and pieces of Midnight Run and 48 Hours -LRB- and , for that matter , Shrek -RRB-  	noemotion	moviereview
15451	9330_2	 A small fortune in salaries and stunt cars might have been saved 	disgust	moviereview
2227	9331_1	An amateurish , quasi-improvised acting exercise shot on ugly digital video .	disgust	moviereview
21477	9332_1	  The holes in this film remain agape -- holes punched through by an inconsistent , meandering , 	disgust	moviereview
21478	9332_2	  and sometimes dry plot . 	disgust	moviereview
2228	9333_1	Would Benigni 's Italian Pinocchio have been any easier to sit through than this hastily dubbed disaster ?	disgust	moviereview
2943	9334_1	Unofficially , National Lampoon 's Van Wilder is Son of Animal House .	joy	moviereview
23941	9335_1	  Officially , it is twice as bestial 	disgust	moviereview
23942	9335_2	  but half as funny . 	disgust	moviereview
15471	9336_1	 that was followed by the bad idea to turn it into a movie  	disgust	moviereview
15493	9336_2	 This is a fragmented film , once a good idea 	disgust	moviereview
4388	9337_1	Mindless yet impressively lean spinoff of last summer 's bloated effects fest The Mummy Returns .	joy	moviereview
2229	9338_1	Halfway through the movie , the humor dwindles .	disgust	moviereview
15513	9339_1	 that are jarring and deeply out of place in what could have -LRB- and probably should have -RRB- been a lighthearted comedy  	disgust	moviereview
15534	9339_2	 It 's replaced by some dramatic scenes 	disgust	moviereview
3661	933_1	The disarming cornball atmosphere has a way of infecting the entire crowd as the film rolls on .	joy	moviereview
4389	9340_1	will be far more interesting to the Soderbergh faithful than it will be to the casual moviegoer who might be lured in by Julia Roberts ...	joy	moviereview
25000	9341_1	  Authentic , 	joy	moviereview
25001	9341_2	  and at times endearing , humorous , spooky , educational , 	joy	moviereview
25002	9341_3	  but at other times as bland as a block of snow . 	disgust	moviereview
2230	9342_1	Control-Alt-Delete Simone as quickly as possible	disgust	moviereview
21479	9343_1	  Follows the original film virtually scene for scene 	disgust	moviereview
21480	9343_2	  and yet manages to bleed it almost completely dry of humor , verve and fun .	disgust	moviereview
23943	9344_1	  The filmmaker ascends , literally , to the Olympus of the art world , 	joy	moviereview
23944	9344_2	  but he would have done well to end this flawed , dazzling series with the raising of something other than his own cremaster . 	disgust	moviereview
4390	9345_1	The screenplay comes across , rather unintentionally , as Hip-Hop Scooby-Doo .	disgust	moviereview
4391	9346_1	Has lost some of the dramatic conviction that underlies the best of comedies ...	disgust	moviereview
23945	9347_1	  Vaguely interesting , 	disgust	moviereview
23946	9347_2	  but it 's just too too much . 	disgust	moviereview
2231	9348_1	... no charm , no laughs , no fun , no reason to watch .	disgust	moviereview
2232	9349_1	A generic family comedy unlikely to be appreciated by anyone outside the under-10 set .	disgust	moviereview
25730	934_1	  A refreshingly honest 	joy	moviereview
25731	934_2	  and ultimately touching tale of the sort of people usually ignored in contemporary American film . 	joy	moviereview
15555	9350_1	 that was developed hastily after Oedekerk  	disgust	moviereview
15576	9350_2	 Kung Pow seems like some futile concoction 	disgust	moviereview
15595	9350_3	 and his fellow moviemakers got through crashing a college keg party .  	disgust	moviereview
21481	9351_1	  Kurys seems intimidated by both her subject matter 	disgust	moviereview
21482	9351_2	  and the period trappings of this debut venture into the heritage business . 	disgust	moviereview
2233	9352_1	The film virtually chokes on its own self-consciousness .	disgust	moviereview
4392	9353_1	A manipulative feminist empowerment tale thinly posing as a serious drama about spousal abuse .	disgust	moviereview
945	9354_1	Everything in Maid in Manhattan is exceedingly pleasant , designed not to offend .	joy	moviereview
946	9355_1	It goes down easy , leaving virtually no aftertaste .	joy	moviereview
21483	9356_1	  A profoundly stupid affair , populating its hackneyed 	disgust	moviereview
21484	9356_2	  and meanspirited storyline with cardboard characters 	disgust	moviereview
21485	9356_3	  and performers who value cash above credibility . 	disgust	moviereview
2234	9357_1	... pays tribute to heroes the way Julia Roberts hands out awards -- with phony humility barely camouflaging grotesque narcissism .	disgust	moviereview
15614	9358_1	 that one in Clockstoppers , a sci-fi thriller as lazy as it is interminable  	disgust	moviereview
15634	9358_2	 Time stands still in more ways 	noemotion	moviereview
21486	9359_1	  As a director , Eastwood is off his game -- there 's no real sense of suspense , 	disgust	moviereview
21487	9359_2	  and none of the plot ` surprises ' are really surprising . 	disgust	moviereview
2746	935_1	Search it out .	noemotion	moviereview
4393	9360_1	Eccentric enough to stave off doldrums , Caruso 's self-conscious debut is also eminently forgettable .	disgust	moviereview
21488	9361_1	  To work , love stories require the full emotional involvement 	disgust	moviereview
21489	9361_2	  and support of a viewer . 	other	moviereview
15655	9362_1	 that set the plot in motion  	joy	moviereview
15676	9362_2	 That is made almost impossible by events 	joy	moviereview
15697	9363_1	 Although Barbershop boasts some of today 's hottest and hippest acts from the world of television , music and stand-up comedy  	disgust	moviereview
15719	9363_2	 , this movie strangely enough has the outdated swagger of a shameless ` 70s blaxploitation shuck-and-jive sitcom .  	disgust	moviereview
15742	9364_1	 A puzzle whose pieces do not fit  	disgust	moviereview
21490	9365_1	  Some are fascinating 	joy	moviereview
21491	9365_2	  and others are not , 	noemotion	moviereview
21492	9365_3	  and in the end , it is almost a good movie . 	joy	moviereview
15784	9366_1	 Would that Greengrass had gone a tad less for grit and a lot more for intelligibility  	disgust	moviereview
2235	9367_1	The good is very , very good ... The rest runs from mildly unimpressive to despairingly awful .	joy	moviereview
15827	9368_1	 who manages to blast even the smallest sensitivities from the romance with his clamorous approach  	disgust	moviereview
15848	9368_2	 ` Butterfingered ' is the word for the big-fisted direction of Jez Butterworth , 	disgust	moviereview
15871	9369_1	 if you 're depressed about anything before watching this film  	disgust	moviereview
15893	9369_2	 Be forewarned , 	disgust	moviereview
15912	9369_3	 , you may just end up trying to drown yourself in a lake afterwards .  	disgust	moviereview
25732	936_1	  Engrossing 	joy	moviereview
25733	936_2	  and affecting , if ultimately not quite satisfying . 	disgust	moviereview
15934	9370_1	 that only ever walked the delicate tightrope between farcical and loathsome  	disgust	moviereview
15957	9370_2	 a terrible adaptation of a play 	disgust	moviereview
2236	9371_1	In the wrong hands , i.e. Peploe 's , it 's simply unbearable	disgust	moviereview
4394	9372_1	An inexperienced director , Mehta has much to learn .	disgust	moviereview
15977	9373_1	 that even he seems embarrassed to be part of  	disgust	moviereview
16000	9373_2	 A limp Eddie Murphy vehicle 	disgust	moviereview
16020	9374_1	 that it says far less about  	disgust	moviereview
16042	9374_2	 So muddled , repetitive and ragged 	disgust	moviereview
16065	9374_3	 the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker 's characteristic style .  	noemotion	moviereview
2237	9375_1	A gushy episode of `` M * A * S * H '' only this time from an Asian perspective .	joy	moviereview
16087	9376_1	 just seems to kinda sit in neutral , hoping for a stiff wind to blow it uphill or something  	disgust	moviereview

21493	9377_1	  Nothing more than four or five mild chuckles surrounded by 86 minutes of overly-familiar 	disgust	moviereview
21494	9377_2	  and poorly-constructed comedy . 	disgust	moviereview
16129	9378_1	 that it is laughingly enjoyable  	joy	moviereview
16149	9378_2	 Definitely in the guilty pleasure B-movie category , Reign of Fire is so incredibly inane 	joy	moviereview
16170	9379_1	 like Clueless Does South Fork  	disgust	moviereview
16192	9379_2	 Good-looking but relentlessly lowbrow outing plays 	disgust	moviereview
25734	937_1	  The story , like life , refuses to be simple , 	joy	moviereview
25735	937_2	  and the result is a compelling slice of awkward emotions . 	joy	moviereview
23947	9380_1	  entertaining enough , 	disgust	moviereview
23948	9380_2	  but nothing new 	disgust	moviereview
2238	9381_1	... one resurrection too many .	disgust	moviereview
16213	9382_1	 that remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout  	disgust	moviereview
16231	9382_2	 This is a film about the irksome , tiresome nature of complacency 	disgust	moviereview
16251	9383_1	 Even as the hero of the story rediscovers his passion in life  	noemotion	moviereview
16272	9383_2	 , the mood remains oddly detached .  	disgust	moviereview
4395	9384_1	DeMeo is not without talent ; he just needs better material .	disgust	moviereview
2239	9385_1	In spite of featuring a script credited to no fewer than five writers , apparently nobody here bothered to check it twice .	disgust	moviereview
21495	9386_1	  No one involved , save Dash , shows the slightest aptitude for acting , 	disgust	moviereview
21496	9386_2	  and the script , credited to director Abdul Malik Abbott 	disgust	moviereview
21497	9386_3	  and Ernest ` Tron ' Anderson , seems entirely improvised . 	disgust	moviereview
2240	9387_1	Initially gripping , eventually cloying POW drama .	disgust	moviereview
2241	9388_1	A timid , soggy near miss .	disgust	moviereview
2242	9389_1	Works better in the conception than it does in the execution ... winds up seeming just a little too clever .	disgust	moviereview
7670	938_1	 A sly game of cat and mouse that 's intense  	joy	moviereview
7671	938_2	 and thrilling at times , but occasionally stretches believability to its limits and relies on predictable plot contrivances . 	disgust	moviereview
16294	9390_1	 To the vast majority of more casual filmgoers 	disgust	moviereview
16314	9390_2	 it will probably be a talky  bore 	disgust	moviereview
21498	9391_1	  Observant intelligence constantly vies with pretension -- 	disgust	moviereview
21499	9391_2	  and sometimes plain wacky implausibility -- throughout Maelstrom . 	disgust	moviereview
2944	9392_1	This version of H.G. Wells ' Time Machine was directed by H.G. Wells ' great-grandson .	noemotion	moviereview

23949	9394_1	  Shunji Iwai 's All About Lily Chou Chou is a beautifully shot , 	joy	moviereview
23950	9394_2	  but ultimately flawed film about growing up in Japan . 	disgust	moviereview
4396	9395_1	With more character development this might have been an eerie thriller ; with better payoffs , it could have been a thinking man 's monster movie .	disgust	moviereview
16336	9396_1	 Gaghan has all the right parts , but the pieces do n't  	disgust	moviereview

21500	9398_1	  There 's not a single jump-in-your-seat moment 	disgust	moviereview

25003	9399_1	  Goldbacher draws on an elegant visual sense 	joy	moviereview
25004	9399_2	  and a talent for easy , seductive pacing ... 	joy	moviereview

23963	9620_1	  Reyes ' directorial debut has good things to offer , 	joy	moviereview

16689	9623_1	 who are intended to make it shine  	disgust	moviereview
16712	9623_2	 ... the picture 's cleverness is ironically muted by the very people 	disgust	moviereview

16734	9625_1	 that could have been much better  	disgust	moviereview
16756	9625_2	 One of those so-so films 	disgust	moviereview
25018	9626_1	  Crossroads feels like a teenybopper Ed Wood film , replete with the pubescent scandalous innuendo 	disgust	moviereview
25019	9626_2	  and the high-strung 	disgust	moviereview
25020	9626_3	  but flaccid drama . 	disgust	moviereview
2277	9627_1	Fails to satisfactorily exploit its gender politics , genre thrills or inherent humor .	disgust	moviereview
16777	9628_1	 the film has a difficult time shaking its Blair Witch Project  	disgust	moviereview
16799	9628_2	 Interview With the Assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic , and as such 	noemotion	moviereview

21573	9629_1	  Cacoyannis ' vision is far less mature , interpreting the play as a call for pity 	disgust	moviereview

131	962_1	... Blade II is more enjoyable than the original .	joy	moviereview
16841	9630_1	 which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline  	disgust	moviereview
16862	9630_2	 It has more in common with a fireworks display than a movie , 	disgust	moviereview
16884	9631_1	 to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept  	disgust	moviereview
16904	9631_2	 It appears to have been made by people 	disgust	moviereview
2278	9632_1	Less a heartfelt appeal for the handicapped than a nice Belgian waffle .	disgust	moviereview
16924	9633_1	 whether you think Kissinger was a calculating fiend or just a slippery self-promoter  	disgust	moviereview

17072	9639_2	 -LRB- T -RRB- he film is never sure to make a clear point -- 	disgust	moviereview
7688	963_1	 A film that takes you inside the rhythms of its subject 	joy	moviereview

17093	9640_1	 While it may not add up to the sum of its parts  	joy	moviereview
17115	9640_2	 , Holofcener 's film offers just enough insight to keep it from being simpleminded , and the ensemble cast is engaging enough to keep you from shifting in your chair too often .  	joy	moviereview
21577	9641_1	  An overwrought Taiwanese soaper about three people 	disgust	moviereview
21578	9641_2	  and their mixed-up relationship . 	noemotion	moviereview
2280	9642_1	Nobody seems to have cared much about any aspect of it , from its cheesy screenplay to the grayish quality of its lighting to its last-minute , haphazard theatrical release .	disgust	moviereview
17138	9643_1	 a geriatric ` Scream . '  	disgust	moviereview
17159	9643_2	 A thoroughly awful movie -- dumb , narratively chaotic , visually sloppy ... a weird amalgam of ` The Thing ' and 	disgust	moviereview
17182	9644_1	 how Sandler is losing his touch  	disgust	moviereview
17205	9644_2	 ... another example of 	noemotion	moviereview

17248	9645_2	 Nothing sticks , really , except a lingering creepiness 	disgust	moviereview
17269	9646_1	 What goes on for the 110 minutes of `` Panic Room ''  	disgust	moviereview
17292	9646_2	 is a battle of witlessness between a not-so-bright mother and daughter and an even less capable trio of criminals .  	disgust	moviereview
4417	9647_1	The plot 's contrivances are uncomfortably strained .	disgust	moviereview
4418	9648_1	Guilty of the worst sin of attributable to a movie like this : it 's not scary in the slightest .	disgust	moviereview
17312	9649_1	 that 's enough to sustain laughs  	disgust	moviereview
17332	9649_2	 Schnieder bounces around with limp wrists , wearing tight tummy tops and hip huggers , twirling his hair on his finger and assuming 	joy	moviereview

25740	964_2	  and its fine acting . 	joy	moviereview
17376	9650_1	 that this is n't something to be taken seriously  	disgust	moviereview
17398	9650_2	 Its simplicity puts an exclamation point on the fact 	joy	moviereview
17420	9650_3	 , but it also wrecks any chance of the movie rising above similar fare .  	disgust	moviereview
17442	9651_1	 that this Mean Machine was a decent TV outing that just does n't have big screen magic  	disgust	moviereview
17464	9651_2	 By the final whistle  	disgust	moviereview
17486	9651_3	 you 're convinced 	disgust	moviereview
17505	9652_1	 that he has severe body odor  	disgust	moviereview
17523	9652_2	 To say that this vapid vehicle is downright doltish and uneventful  	disgust	moviereview
17562	9652_4	 is just as obvious as telling a country skunk 	disgust	moviereview
17584	9653_1	 in which murder is casual and fun  	disgust	moviereview
17605	9653_2	 A film of empty , fetishistic violence 	disgust	moviereview

23965	9655_1	  It 's fun , 	joy	moviereview

23967	9656_1	  Some fine acting , 	joy	moviereview
23968	9656_2	  but ultimately a movie with no reason for being . 	disgust	moviereview
17670	9657_1	 while watching this movie , beyond mild disturbance or detached pleasure at the acting  	disgust	moviereview
17692	9657_2	 It 's difficult to feel anything much 	disgust	moviereview
17715	9658_1	 that wastes the talents of its attractive young leads  	disgust	moviereview
17735	9658_2	 A waterlogged version of ` Fatal Attraction ' for the teeny-bopper set ... a sad , soggy potboiler 	disgust	moviereview
17757	9659_1	 that you should have gotten more out of it than you did  	disgust	moviereview
17777	9659_2	 It tells its story in a flat manner and leaves you with the impression 	disgust	moviereview
25741	965_1	  The movie is saved from unbearable lightness by the simplicity of the storytelling 	joy	moviereview
25742	965_2	  and the authenticity of the performances . 	joy	moviereview
17799	9660_1	 the screenwriters just do a cut-and-paste of every bad action-movie line in history  	disgust	moviereview
17819	9660_2	 Sweet gentle Jesus , did 	joy	moviereview
23969	9661_1	  It 's not the worst comedy of the year , 	disgust	moviereview
23970	9661_2	  but it certainly wo n't win any honors . 	disgust	moviereview
4419	9662_1	This is for the most part a useless movie , even with a great director at the helm .	disgust	moviereview
17840	9663_1	 that has none of the charm and little of the intrigue from the TV series  	disgust	moviereview
17861	9663_2	 A loud , witless mess 	disgust	moviereview
21579	9664_1	  Even on its own ludicrous terms , The Sum of All Fears generates little narrative momentum , 	disgust	moviereview
21580	9664_2	  and invites unflattering comparisons to other installments in the Ryan series . 	disgust	moviereview
17882	9665_1	 Though it inspires some -LRB- out-of-field -RRB- creative thought  	joy	moviereview
17904	9665_2	 , the film is -- to its own detriment -- much more a cinematic collage than a polemical tract .  	disgust	moviereview
17926	9666_1	 than you 'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre  	disgust	moviereview
17946	9666_2	 As predictable as the outcome of a Globetrotters-Generals game , Juwanna Mann is even more ludicrous 	disgust	moviereview
17967	9666_3	 , and a personal low for everyone involved .  	disgust	moviereview
21581	9667_1	  Sinks into the usual cafeteria goulash of fart jokes , masturbation jokes , 	disgust	moviereview
21582	9667_2	  and racist Japanese jokes . 	disgust	moviereview
17987	9668_1	 Where Tom Green stages his gags as assaults on America 's knee-jerk moral sanctimony  	disgust	moviereview
18008	9668_2	 , Jackass lacks aspirations of social upheaval .  	disgust	moviereview
4420	9669_1	More of an intriguing curiosity than a gripping thriller .	joy	moviereview
24376	966_1	  The film starts out as competent 	joy	moviereview
24377	966_2	  but unremarkable ... 	disgust	moviereview
24378	966_3	  and gradually grows into something of considerable power . 	joy	moviereview
25024	9670_1	  The April 2002 instalment of the American War for Independence , complete with loads of CGI 	disgust	moviereview
25025	9670_2	  and bushels of violence , 	disgust	moviereview
25026	9670_3	  but not a drop of human blood . 	noemotion	moviereview
23971	9671_1	  Contains all the substance of a Twinkie -- easy to swallow , 	disgust	moviereview
23972	9671_2	  but scarcely nourishing . 	disgust	moviereview
21583	9672_1	  Return to Neverland manages to straddle the line between another classic for the company 	disgust	moviereview
21584	9672_2	  and just another run-of-the-mill Disney sequel intended for the home video market . 	disgust	moviereview
21585	9673_1	  Rarely does a film so graceless 	disgust	moviereview
21586	9673_2	  and devoid of merit as this one come along . 	disgust	moviereview
21587	9674_1	  It 's a thin notion , repetitively stretched out to feature length , awash in self-consciously flashy camera effects , droning house music 	disgust	moviereview
21588	9674_2	  and flat , flat dialogue . 	disgust	moviereview
18029	9675_1	 what it promises , just not well enough to recommend it  	disgust	moviereview
18051	9675_2	 On a certain base level , Blue Crush delivers 	disgust	moviereview
2281	9676_1	The colorful Masseur wastes its time on mood rather than riding with the inherent absurdity of Ganesh 's rise up the social ladder .	disgust	moviereview
18073	9677_1	 that feels all too familiar  	disgust	moviereview
18096	9677_2	 ... an incredibly heavy-handed , manipulative dud 	disgust	moviereview
21589	9678_1	  Wimps out by going for that PG-13 rating , so the more graphic violence is mostly off-screen 	disgust	moviereview
21590	9678_2	  and the sexuality is muted . 	noemotion	moviereview
21591	9679_1	  Trapped presents a frightening 	fear	moviereview

18205	9681_2	 Madonna has made herself over so often now , there 's apparently nothing 	disgust	moviereview
18228	9681_3	 , sort of like Michael Jackson 's nose .  	noemotion	moviereview
18246	9682_1	 that what we have here is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days  	disgust	moviereview
18266	9682_2	 Never having seen the first two films in the series , I ca n't compare Friday After Next to them , but nothing would change the fact 	noemotion	moviereview
21593	9683_1	  The story is lacking any real emotional impact , 	disgust	moviereview
21594	9683_2	  and the plot is both contrived 	disgust	moviereview
21595	9683_3	  and cliched . 	disgust	moviereview
2282	9684_1	A depraved , incoherent , instantly disposable piece of hackery .	disgust	moviereview
18289	9685_1	 because there 's no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring  	disgust	moviereview
18311	9685_2	 It 's a bad action movie 	disgust	moviereview
21596	9686_1	  -LRB- Soderbergh -RRB- tends to place most of the psychological 	joy	moviereview
21597	9686_2	  and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience 's intelligence , 	disgust	moviereview
21598	9686_3	  and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness . 	disgust	moviereview
25027	9687_1	  Handsome 	joy	moviereview
25028	9687_2	  and sincere 	joy	moviereview
25029	9687_3	  but slightly awkward in its combination of entertainment 	other	moviereview

18353	9688_2	 So aggressively cheery 	disgust	moviereview

21599	9690_1	  Russell lacks the visual panache , the comic touch , 	disgust	moviereview

23973	9693_1	  The Sum of All Fears pretends to be a serious exploration of nuclear terrorism , 	disgust	moviereview
23974	9693_2	  but it 's really nothing more than warmed-over Cold War paranoia . 	disgust	moviereview
21601	9694_1	  A listless 	disgust	moviereview
21602	9694_2	  and desultory affair . 	disgust	moviereview

2288	9712_1	A bit too derivative to stand on its own as the psychological thriller it purports to be .	disgust	moviereview
13227	9713_1	 that the playwright Craig Lucas explored with infinitely more grace and eloquence in his Prelude to a  Kiss 	joy	moviereview

16215	9834_2	 The whole thing feels like a ruse , a tactic to cover up the fact 	disgust	moviereview
16253	9835_1	 this is  	disgust	moviereview
16274	9835_2	 What a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess 	disgust	moviereview
16296	9836_1	 that it feels more like the pilot episode of a TV series than a feature film  	disgust	moviereview
16316	9836_2	 The film is so packed with subplots involving the various Silbersteins 	disgust	moviereview
2308	9837_1	Opera on film is never satisfactory .	disgust	moviereview
959	9838_1	The art demands live viewing .	joy	moviereview

25752	983_2	  and , yes , melancholy film . 	joy	moviereview
2309	9840_1	Despite all the closed-door hanky-panky , the film is essentially juiceless .	disgust	moviereview
16424	9841_1	 a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill  	joy	moviereview
16445	9841_2	 It is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests 	disgust	moviereview
2310	9842_1	The Sweetest Thing leaves an awful sour taste .	disgust	moviereview
21646	9843_1	  It 's lost the politics 	noemotion	moviereview
21647	9843_2	  and the social observation 	disgust	moviereview
21648	9843_3	  and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay . 	disgust	moviereview
21649	9844_1	  Terminally bland , painfully slow 	disgust	moviereview
21650	9844_2	  and needlessly confusing ... The movie , shot on digital videotape rather than film , is frequently indecipherable . 	disgust	moviereview
16468	9845_1	 As dumb and cheesy as they may be  	disgust	moviereview
16512	9845_3	 , the cartoons look almost Shakespearean -- both in depth and breadth -- after watching this digital-effects-heavy , supposed family-friendly comedy .  	disgust	moviereview
16534	9846_1	 that relies on personal relationships  	disgust	moviereview
16557	9846_2	 Aloof and lacks any real raw emotion , which is fatal for a film 	disgust	moviereview

4434	9849_1	Its initial excitement settles into a warmed over pastiche .	disgust	moviereview
134	984_1	From spiritual rebirth to bruising defeat , Vincent 's odyssey resonates in a profound way , comparable to the classic films of Jean Renoir .	joy	moviereview
16579	9850_1	 that the talented cast generally chokes on  	disgust	moviereview
16602	9850_2	 A big meal of cliches 	disgust	moviereview
21651	9851_1	  The story has little wit 	disgust	moviereview

16625	9852_1	 we hold dear about cinema , only now it 's begun to split up so that it can do even more damage  	disgust	moviereview
16646	9852_2	 The Merchant-Ivory team continues to systematically destroy everything 	disgust	moviereview
16667	9853_1	 is instead about as fresh as last week 's issue of Variety  	disgust	moviereview
16690	9853_2	 What should have been a cutting Hollywood satire 	disgust	moviereview

21653	9856_1	  A little more intensity 	noemotion	moviereview
21654	9856_2	  and a little less charm would have saved this film a world of hurt . 	disgust	moviereview

16778	9857_2	 -LRB- T -RRB- his slop does n't even have potential as a cult film , 	disgust	moviereview
21655	9858_1	  The movie 's plot is almost entirely witless 	disgust	moviereview
21656	9858_2	  and inane , carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh . 	disgust	moviereview
16800	9859_1	 as an addictive guilty pleasure but the material never overcomes its questionable satirical ambivalence  	disgust	moviereview
16821	9859_2	 ... may work 	joy	moviereview
25753	985_1	  Novak manages to capture a cruelly hilarious vein of black comedy in the situation with his cast of non-actors 	joy	moviereview
25754	985_2	  and a gritty , no-budget approach . 	disgust	moviereview
2955	9860_1	This Scarlet 's letter is A. . .	noemotion	moviereview
2312	9861_1	as in aimless , arduous , and arbitrary .	disgust	moviereview
16842	9862_1	 that occasionally verges on camp  	disgust	moviereview

4435	9863_1	The central character is n't complex enough to hold our interest .	disgust	moviereview
16885	9864_1	 that requires the enemy to never shoot straight  	joy	moviereview
16905	9864_2	 that , in terms of authenticity , is one of those films 	noemotion	moviereview
16925	9864_3	 A modestly comic , modestly action-oriented World War II adventure 	joy	moviereview
16964	9865_1	 it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks  	disgust	moviereview
16986	9865_2	 A puppy dog so desperate for attention 	disgust	moviereview
17008	9866_1	 than it needs to be  	disgust	moviereview
17029	9866_2	 Just about all of the film is confusing on one level or another , making Ararat far more demanding 	disgust	moviereview
21657	9867_1	  A little less extreme than in the past , with longer exposition sequences between them , 	joy	moviereview
21658	9867_2	  and with fewer gags to break the tedium . 	disgust	moviereview
2313	9868_1	There 's a heavy stench of ` been there , done that ' hanging over the film .	disgust	moviereview
17051	9869_1	 you 'd expect -- but nothing more  	disgust	moviereview
17073	9869_2	 It 's everything 	disgust	moviereview

17139	9871_3	 but does n't reveal an inner life .  	disgust	moviereview
960	9872_1	A quaint , romanticized rendering .	joy	moviereview
2314	9873_1	What with the incessant lounge music playing in the film 's background , you may mistake Love Liza for an Adam Sandler Chanukah song .	disgust	moviereview
21659	9874_1	  The movie 's heavy-handed screenplay navigates a fast fade into pomposity 	disgust	moviereview
21660	9874_2	  and pretentiousness . 	disgust	moviereview
21661	9875_1	  A potentially good comic premise 	disgust	moviereview
21662	9875_2	  and excellent cast are terribly wasted . 	disgust	moviereview
2956	9876_1	Woody Allen used to ridicule movies like Hollywood Ending .	disgust	moviereview

23983	9879_1	  Not a bad premise , 	joy	moviereview

25045	9883_2	  and well-drawn , if standard issue , characters , 	joy	moviereview
25046	9883_3	  but is still only partly satisfying . 	disgust	moviereview
17249	9884_1	 Even if it made its original release date last fall  	disgust	moviereview
17270	9884_2	 , it would 've reeked of a been-there , done-that sameness .  	disgust	moviereview
2315	9885_1	Only two-fifths of a satisfying movie experience .	disgust	moviereview
2316	9886_1	A loud , ugly , irritating movie without any of its satirical salvos hitting a discernible target .	disgust	moviereview
4438	9887_1	A movie version of a paint-by-numbers picture .	disgust	moviereview
17293	9888_1	 what it is supposed to be , but ca n't really call it a work of art  	disgust	moviereview
17313	9888_2	 We can tell 	noemotion	moviereview
17333	9889_1	 bore except when the fantastic Kathy Bates turns up  	disgust	moviereview
17354	9889_2	 It 's a brilliant , honest performance by Nicholson , but the film is an agonizing 	disgust	moviereview
3667	988_1	There was time on that second round to see the subtleties of Ramsay 's portrait of grief .	joy	moviereview
961	9890_1	Bravado Kathy !	joy	moviereview

17524	9895_3	 to or affection for its characters , the Reginald Hudlin comedy relies on toilet humor , ethnic slurs .  	disgust	moviereview
23985	9896_1	  Basically , it 's pretty 	joy	moviereview

17544	9897_1	 how much souvlaki can you take before indigestion sets in  	disgust	moviereview
17563	9897_2	 This romantic/comedy asks the question 	noemotion	moviereview
4441	9898_1	Squandering his opportunity to make absurdist observations , Burns gets caught up in the rush of slapstick thoroughfare .	disgust	moviereview
17585	9899_1	 that could have wrapped things up at 80 minutes  	disgust	moviereview
17606	9899_2	 There 's a neat twist , subtly rendered , 	joy	moviereview
17628	9899_3	 , but Kang tacks on three or four more endings .  	disgust	moviereview
24382	989_1	  We can see the wheels turning , 	joy	moviereview
24383	989_2	  and we might resent it sometimes , 	disgust	moviereview
24384	989_3	  but this is still a nice little picture , made by bright 	joy	moviereview
24385	989_4	  and friendly souls with a lot of good cheer . 	joy	moviereview
17	98_1	The tenderness of the piece is still intact .	joy	moviereview
17648	9900_1	 while Said attempts to wear down possible pupils through repetition  	disgust	moviereview

23987	9901_1	  It has no affect on the Kurds , 	disgust	moviereview
23988	9901_2	  but it wore me down . 	disgust	moviereview
21663	9902_1	  The actors improvise 	noemotion	moviereview
21664	9902_2	  and scream their way around this movie directionless , lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary to make this kind of idea work on screen . 	disgust	moviereview
2317	9903_1	Co-writer/director Jonathan Parker 's attempts to fashion a Brazil-like , hyper-real satire fall dreadfully short .	disgust	moviereview
962	9904_1	If this silly little cartoon can inspire a few kids not to grow up to be greedy bastards , more power to it .	joy	moviereview
25047	9905_1	  A superfluous sequel ... plagued by that old familiar feeling of ` let 's get this thing over with ' : Everyone has shown up at the appointed time 	disgust	moviereview

17736	9908_1	 What 's missing in Murder by Numbers  	disgust	moviereview
17758	9908_2	 is any real psychological grounding for the teens ' deviant behaviour .  	disgust	moviereview
21665	9909_1	  Being latently gay 	disgust	moviereview
21666	9909_2	  and liking to read are hardly enough . 	disgust	moviereview
7713	990_1	 pushes the boundaries of biography , and challenges its audience  	joy	moviereview
7714	990_2	 A comprehensive and provocative film -- one that 	joy	moviereview
21667	9910_1	  An uninspired preachy 	disgust	moviereview
21668	9910_2	  and clichd war film . 	disgust	moviereview
17778	9911_1	 that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it is n't incomprehensible  	disgust	moviereview
17800	9911_2	 Horrendously amateurish filmmaking 	disgust	moviereview
17820	9912_1	 that harps on media-constructed ` issues ' like whether compromise  	disgust	moviereview
17841	9912_2	 A movie 	joy	moviereview

21669	9913_1	  Slackers ' jokey approach to college education is disappointingly simplistic -- the film 's biggest problem -- 	disgust	moviereview
21670	9913_2	  and there are no unforgettably stupid stunts or uproariously rude lines of dialogue to remember it by . 	disgust	moviereview
17883	9914_1	 If Festival in Cannes nails hard  	disgust	moviereview
17905	9914_2	 - boiled Hollywood argot with a bracingly nasty accuracy , much about the film , including some of its casting , is frustratingly unconvincing .  	disgust	moviereview
2319	9915_1	The movie is too impressed with its own solemn insights to work up much entertainment value .	disgust	moviereview
2320	9916_1	I have n't seen such self-amused trash since Freddy Got Fingered .	disgust	moviereview
4442	9917_1	Little more than a well-mounted history lesson .	disgust	moviereview
2321	9918_1	Rob Schneider 's infantile cross-dressing routines fill The Hot Chick , the latest gimmick from this unimaginative comedian .	disgust	moviereview
2322	9919_1	A horrible , 99-minute stink bomb .	disgust	moviereview
7715	991_1	 The way Coppola professes his love for movies 	joy	moviereview
7716	991_2	 both colorful pop junk and the classics 	joy	moviereview

17927	9920_1	 who are either too goodly , wise  	disgust	moviereview
17947	9920_2	 The film is weighed down by supporting characters 	disgust	moviereview
17968	9920_3	 and knowing or downright comically evil .  	disgust	moviereview
17988	9921_1	 it does n't improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen  	disgust	moviereview
18009	9921_2	 The film is so bad 	disgust	moviereview
2323	9922_1	Sheridan 's take on the author 's schoolboy memoir ... is a rather toothless take on a hard young life .	disgust	moviereview
2324	9923_1	It jumps around with little logic or continuity , presenting backstage bytes of information that never amount to a satisfying complete picture of this particular , anciently demanding mtier .	disgust	moviereview
18030	9924_1	 How I Killed My Father is one of those art house films that makes you feel like you 're watching an iceberg melt -- only  	disgust	moviereview
18052	9924_2	 it never melts .  	disgust	moviereview
18074	9925_1	 When it comes to the battle of Hollywood vs. Woo  	disgust	moviereview
18097	9925_2	 , it looks like Woo 's a P.O.W.  	disgust	moviereview
18119	9926_1	 that really scores , and the stars seem to be in two different movies  	disgust	moviereview
18141	9926_2	 There are a few chuckles , but not a single gag sequence 	disgust	moviereview
25050	9927_1	  The Chateau has one very funny joke 	joy	moviereview
25051	9927_2	  and a few other decent ones , 	joy	moviereview
25052	9927_3	  but all it amounts to is a mildly funny , sometimes tedious , ultimately insignificant film . 	disgust	moviereview
21671	9928_1	  It 's dull , spiritless , silly 	disgust	moviereview
21672	9928_2	  and monotonous : an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast . 	disgust	moviereview
4443	9929_1	The mushy finale turns John Q into a movie-of-the-week tearjerker .	sadness	moviereview
135	992_1	A worthwhile way to spend two hours .	joy	moviereview
21673	9930_1	  Content merely to lionize its title character 	disgust	moviereview
21674	9930_2	  and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills 	disgust	moviereview
21675	9930_3	  and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance . 	disgust	moviereview
4444	9931_1	The movie turns out to be -LRB- Assayas ' -RRB- homage to the Gallic ` tradition of quality , ' in all its fusty squareness .	joy	moviereview
21676	9932_1	  Its message has merit 	joy	moviereview
21677	9932_2	  and , in the hands of a brutally honest individual like Prophet Jack , might have made a point or two regarding life . 	joy	moviereview
21678	9933_1	  -LRB- Seems -RRB- even more uselessly redundant 	disgust	moviereview
21679	9933_2	  and shamelessly money-grubbing than most third-rate horror sequels . 	disgust	moviereview
18160	9934_1	 that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread  	disgust	moviereview
18183	9934_2	 It 's hard to imagine 	disgust	moviereview
18206	9935_1	 as you 've paid a matinee price  	noemotion	moviereview
18229	9935_2	 Neither as scary-funny as Tremors nor demented-funny as Starship Troopers , the movie is n't tough to take as long 	disgust	moviereview
18247	9936_1	 If swimfan does catch on  	joy	moviereview
18267	9936_2	 because teens are looking for something to make them laugh  	joy	moviereview
18290	9936_3	 , it may be 	noemotion	moviereview
18312	9937_1	 What might 've been an exhilarating exploration of an odd love triangle  	disgust	moviereview
18332	9937_2	 becomes a sprawl of uncoordinated vectors .  	disgust	moviereview
18354	9938_1	 it is not  	disgust	moviereview
18375	9938_2	 The Master of Disguise may have made a great Saturday Night Live sketch , but a great movie 	joy	moviereview
21680	9939_1	  It 's quite an achievement to set 	joy	moviereview
21681	9939_2	  and shoot a movie at the Cannes Film Festival 	disgust	moviereview
21682	9939_3	  and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere . 	disgust	moviereview
25755	993_1	  Francophiles will snicker knowingly 	disgust	moviereview
25756	993_2	  and you 'll want to slap them . 	disgust	moviereview
25053	9940_1	  Boll uses a lot of quick cutting 	disgust	moviereview
25054	9940_2	  and blurry step-printing to goose things up , 	disgust	moviereview
25055	9940_3	  but dopey dialogue 	disgust	moviereview
25056	9940_4	  and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect . 	disgust	moviereview
18396	9941_1	 when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic  	disgust	moviereview
18418	9941_2	 It 's always disappointing 	disgust	moviereview
18438	9942_1	 precisely what Arthur Dong 's Family Fundamentals does  	disgust	moviereview
18460	9942_2	 Unfortunately , that 's 	disgust	moviereview
2325	9943_1	Has the marks of a septuagenarian ; it 's a crusty treatment of a clever gimmick .	disgust	moviereview
18480	9944_1	 that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen  	disgust	moviereview
18501	9944_2	 Like a medium-grade network sitcom -- mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless 	disgust	moviereview
4445	9945_1	Something must have been lost in the translation .	disgust	moviereview
2326	9946_1	Becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any Plympton film : boring .	disgust	moviereview
13074	9947_1	 as if we 're looking back at a tattered and ugly past with rose-tinted glasses  	disgust	moviereview
13097	9947_2	 In the end , the film feels homogenized and a bit contrived , 	disgust	moviereview
13119	9948_1	 that there 's really not much of a sense of action or even action-comedy  	disgust	moviereview
13141	9948_2	 Chan 's stunts are limited and so embellished by editing 	disgust	moviereview
4446	9949_1	Rock 's stand-up magic wanes .	joy	moviereview
